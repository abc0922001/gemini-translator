# GitHub Actions Workflows Summary

Your Gemini SRT Translator project now has a complete CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions! ðŸŽ‰

## What Was Added

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflows (`.github/workflows/`)

- **`ci.yml`** - Continuous Integration
  - Runs on push/PR to main/develop branches
  - Tests on Node.js 18.x, 20.x, 22.x
  - Validates package and runs security audits

- **`publish.yml`** - NPM Publishing
  - Triggers when you create a GitHub release
  - Automatically publishes to NPM
  - Uploads package to release assets

- **`code-quality.yml`** - Code Quality Checks
  - Runs linting and formatting checks
  - Security audits and dependency reviews
  - Checks for outdated packages

- **`auto-release.yml`** - Automated Releases
  - Creates GitHub releases when package.json version changes
  - Generates changelog from git commits
  - Tags releases automatically

### 2. Enhanced Package Scripts

Updated `package.json` with better scripts:
- `npm test` - Runs comprehensive tests
- `npm run lint` - Basic linting checks
- `npm run validate` - Package validation
- Pre-publish hooks for quality assurance

### 3. Test Suite (`tests/test-runner.js`)

Created a basic test runner that validates:
- File existence and structure
- Package.json configuration
- Syntax checking
- CLI functionality

### 4. Documentation

- **`.github/ACTIONS_SETUP.md`** - Detailed setup instructions
- **Workflow status badges** - Added to README.md
- **This summary file** - Quick overview

## Next Steps

### 1. Set Up Repository Secrets

Add these secrets in your GitHub repository settings:

```
NPM_TOKEN          - Your NPM automation token
GEMINI_API_KEY     - Your Gemini API key (optional)
```

### 2. Test the Workflows

1. Push changes to trigger CI:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflows"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Update version to trigger auto-release:
   ```bash
   npm version patch
   git push origin main --follow-tags
   ```

### 3. Monitor Workflow Status

- Check the Actions tab in your GitHub repository
- Watch for the workflow status badges in your README
- Monitor NPM for successful package publications
