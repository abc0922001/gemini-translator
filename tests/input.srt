1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:01,875
we are going between agent edit

2
00:00:01,875 --> 00:00:05,750
and ask to kind of show how you can use

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,333
these three different modes.

4
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:08,875
ask is really good at talking

5
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:10,583
through changes that you want to do.

6
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:12,833
Edit mode is for those specific changes

7
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:13,750
that you want.

8
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:14,958
And then agent mode

9
00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:16,125
is when you just want to vibe,

10
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:17,208
So you just use Agent Mode

11
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:18,291
to get it done for you.

12
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:19,750
Agent mode is just so good.

13
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,875
Honestly. Yes.

14
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:24,875
Oh my goodness.

15
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:31,625
Hi everyone.

16
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,833
I'm Kate Asia and I'm here with John.

17
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:36,500
And today what are we doing John.

18
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,666
I think we're going to take a look

19
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:39,291
at the whole bunch of different models

20
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:40,750
that are available inside copilot.

21
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,125
And we're going to

22
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:43,083
just try them out in the different modes.

23
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:45,000
So there's, ask mode

24
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,291
where we can just ask questions,

25
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:48,916
get responses from Copilot.

26
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:50,291
There's edit mode

27
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:53,000
where we can pull in a bunch of files

28
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,750
and do mass edits, refactor

29
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,250
changes across them.

30
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,208
And then there's agent mode

31
00:00:58,208 --> 00:00:59,541
which is really great.

32
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:00,916
and this is one of my favorite ways

33
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:03,291
to, to do prompting for agent mode.

34
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:03,500
Right.

35
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,500
Because what it does, it takes

36
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:09,708
really a fairly large prompt, usually,

37
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:11,541
pretty descriptive

38
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:12,750
about a number of different things

39
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:13,666
you want to do.

40
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:15,500
And it's going to run through it.

41
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,666
It's going to pause every now

42
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:18,500
and then kind of ask

43
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,875
if it's doing the right thing,

44
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:21,625
tell us what it wants to do next.

45
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:23,041
Go ahead and do more.

46
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,000
And then we get

47
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,750
to kind of check in with it

48
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,333
and see how the progress is going

49
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:27,000
each time.

50
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,083
But one of the keys to

51
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:29,916
that is having

52
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:31,791
a really good solid prompt.

53
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:32,916
So yes,

54
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:33,916
it's kind of my standard

55
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:34,833
for how I tend to do it

56
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:35,166
nowadays,

57
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:36,500
where I actually just put the prompt

58
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,333
into a read, me and, you know, just just

59
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,166
so our audience knows,

60
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:44,250
this is not my first cut at this, right?

61
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,583
Meaning

62
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:47,250
I was kind of working with copilot

63
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,083
and saying, like, okay,

64
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:49,041
this is what I want to do,

65
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,875
but help me refine this.

66
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:51,833
Read me

67
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:53,791
basically making it a full PDF

68
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:55,666
for product requirement stock,

69
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,333
and putting all the things in there

70
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,000
that we would need

71
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,958
and then testing it out

72
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:00,375
a little bit to see what things were good

73
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:01,166
and what things were weren't.

74
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:02,875
I imagine that's a lot of what

75
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:04,041
a lot of the developers out

76
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:04,958
there are hitting, right.

77
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:05,791
It's just kind of

78
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:08,166
tuning their prompts properly.

79
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:10,250
So yes, the situation they're in.

80
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,791
So it's like using Copilot

81
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:13,125
to create that PRD,

82
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,458
to use Copilot to build

83
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,708
the app based on the PRD, I love it.

84
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:18,875
so what we've got here then

85
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,416
is, is this read me now,

86
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:21,416
which really contains

87
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:22,125
all the stuff

88
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,750
that I'm gonna feed into copilot.

89
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,916
And I guess you're going to do with it

90
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:27,833
all, and we'll see how it goes.

91
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,250
It's a basic travel

92
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,541
reservation app, you know?

93
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:33,166
So, I want to view hotel rooms.

94
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:33,750
I want to be able to make

95
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,583
a reservation, etc..

96
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:36,833
And intentionally we're

97
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,250
keeping the technology stack

98
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,875
really simple here, right?

99
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,916
Obviously more complex.

100
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:42,875
This isn't the way you do it

101
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:43,916
in a real production app.

102
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:44,208
I'm like,

103
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:45,708
loading Vue.js from a car

104
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:46,833
and I don't have a build step

105
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,083
for the front end, that kind of stuff.

106
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,208
It's okay.

107
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,583
Okay, we want it to be fast

108
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,208
so our viewers don't have to wait forever

109
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:53,375
for a million,

110
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:54,416
you know, node modules

111
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,416
to pull down and install and all of that.

112
00:02:58,291 --> 00:02:59,958
And we've got some specific instructions.

113
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:02,041
This is something I really like to do

114
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:03,625
where I'm going to initially outline

115
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,416
what the project structure

116
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:06,666
is going to be.

117
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:07,958
Now, some of the models

118
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,083
that we're going to play with,

119
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,625
except visual inputs too.

120
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,666
So I could just as a visual diagram,

121
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,208
but you know, for now

122
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,166
I'm just doing it in markdown here

123
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,208
so that the models can read it.

124
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:20,458
And I really love that,

125
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:21,791
you know, you've structured

126
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:22,750
the read me this way

127
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,500
because sometimes when I ask agent mode

128
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,625
with whichever model to,

129
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,416
you know, to spin up a react

130
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:31,375
app or spin up a Vue

131
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:34,333
app, it's not able to do it accurately.

132
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,416
So I think having this project structure

133
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,500
to tell it, hey, here's

134
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,166
exactly how I want you to do this.

135
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:39,916
I think that's going

136
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:40,583
to make a difference.

137
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,375
I'm curious to see how that works.

138
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:42,750
Plus, it's

139
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,333
an opportunity for us as developers

140
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,666
to kind of make thing to content

141
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,083
if we like to have it structured

142
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:48,750
because we all have a

143
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,208
different preferences

144
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:51,000
where exactly

145
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,791
we want our templates, where we want,

146
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:53,041
you know,

147
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,458
our virtual end to exist,

148
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:55,791
Every good read. Me too.

149
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:56,833
Always has set up instructions.

150
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,875
And that's useful for us as humans,

151
00:03:58,875 --> 00:03:59,583
because of course,

152
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:00,875
we're going to want to be able to go in

153
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,833
and set up this project elsewhere.

154
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:05,416
But it's also really useful to the model

155
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:06,958
because it can look through this

156
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,458
and I can get hints as to some

157
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,458
I want like,

158
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:10,833
you know,

159
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:11,125
I'm saying

160
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,041
explicitly here,

161
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:12,791
like you're going to set up

162
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,375
a Python virtual environment.

163
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:15,916
Best practice right?

164
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,833
So hopefully we will run it through.

165
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:20,333
It'll actually go and do that for us.

166
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,208
how is the read me

167
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,083
right and copilot instructions.

168
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,916
How are these two different.

169
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:30,875
So in the instructions we have like

170
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:34,041
operator interaction security environment

171
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:37,208
variables version control code styling.

172
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,000
So it's essentially

173
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,416
like guiding the model

174
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:42,125
on how you wanted to build the app

175
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,500
testing requirements.

176
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,750
Python projects I can see.

177
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,125
So like the read me is the PRD

178
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,041
essentially where you're like,

179
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,166
hey, here's what we're building.

180
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,500
Here is a tech stack.

181
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,250
And then in the instructions

182
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,291
you went ahead and gave it

183
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,708
like specific guidelines

184
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:55,250
on what you want,

185
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,250
the shape of the code to be.

186
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:57,708
Yeah.

187
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:58,250
And the

188
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,666
instructions are something

189
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,041
I'll actually end up reusing

190
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,875
between projects often. Right.

191
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,333
So if people haven't used

192
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,916
copilot instructions yet,

193
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,291
I think to know about it,

194
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:08,250
is it basically

195
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,708
it's kind of like the pre prompt.

196
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:10,625
Like before you begin

197
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:11,916
any interaction session

198
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,000
with copilot,

199
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,666
it's going to have that already there.

200
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:18,083
It's going to know the instructions file.

201
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,458
So when you're working on one project

202
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:21,416
you put in their stuff

203
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:22,500
that you want to apply kind of

204
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,291
to every interaction you have.

205
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,166
But you also want to narrow it down.

206
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,416
So, you know, that's why there's that.

207
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:28,833
Like for Python projects,

208
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,833
only if I happen doing a step

209
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,625
that's not related to Python,

210
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,333
it should basically

211
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,333
just ignore that section

212
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,208
because it's not going to be relevant.

213
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:37,958
But then the other thing

214
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:38,666
is I'll take this

215
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:39,416
and I'll take the same

216
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:40,458
copilot instructions file.

217
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:41,375
And it's just one of those things

218
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:44,333
I seed into any new project,

219
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,666
and I might adjust it,

220
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:46,583
but there's certain things

221
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:47,291
that I'm going to want

222
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,083
always to be the same. Right?

223
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:49,750
For sure.

224
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,750
So here's one that I

225
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,625
that I think is kind of fun.

226
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:54,291
I picked this up

227
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,791
from someone actually, at a conference

228
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,083
a little while ago.

229
00:05:57,083 --> 00:06:00,000
And this has copilots working.

230
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,750
I want a history of what it's doing.

231
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,041
Right.

232
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,916
Because eventually that chat session

233
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:04,791
is going to go away.

234
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,416
You know, I'm going to restart vs code.

235
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,125
I'm going to clear it out

236
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,333
and do something else.

237
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,166
I want an actual record,

238
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,458
not just of the actual commits,

239
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:13,666
but of the actual changes

240
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:14,458
that occurred locally

241
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,583
before I even necessarily

242
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,875
committed anything.

243
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,291
So I just tell it.

244
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,666
Hey, make of changelog.md

245
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:23,625
and then each time you do something,

246
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,250
add on to that changelog.

247
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,625
And that just gives me a history.

248
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:27,916
I can see.

249
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:28,291
Love it.

250
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:29,750
I've never seen this before

251
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,375
and now that I'm looking at it,

252
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,083
it makes so much sense.

253
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:33,791
It makes so much,

254
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:34,333
so much sense

255
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,166
to have it do its own

256
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,708
versioning on the of the changes

257
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:37,583
that it's doing.

258
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:38,666
But should we like,

259
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,833
get into building something?

260
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,083
Let's we've talked enough.

261
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,625
Let's let's make this happen. All right.

262
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:46,375
What model do you want

263
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,625
to play with today.

264
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:52,625
So I've been partial towards cloud 3.5.

265
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:53,791
For some reason

266
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:56,791
I tend to get the best results from 30.5,

267
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,041
but I am open. But okay.

268
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,500
So I can start with 3.5.

269
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,458
And you can do.

270
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:02,833
Yeah.

271
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:03,958
I'll, and actually

272
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,166
before I even pick, why don't

273
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,666
why don't we point out to right here

274
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm looking in ask mode.

275
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,208
Uhhuh. And there's three modes, right.

276
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,250
There's there's ask, there's edit

277
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,375
and there's agent. Right.

278
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,458
So an ask mode,

279
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,333
you have the largest breadth

280
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,791
of selection for your models.

281
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,208
So yes we could do this

282
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,000
list is a lot bigger

283
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
when you move into Agent mode

284
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,916
you get a subset of certain models.

285
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,958
Just don't work in agent mode. Right.

286
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:30,583
Okay.

287
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,625
So this is what we have to work from

288
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:32,208
for now.

289
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,166
And then we'll go and play

290
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,791
with the others and ask mode later,

291
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:35,458
I guess.

292
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,625
So let me do three five.

293
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,083
You know what?

294
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,083
Let's let's give people a preview. Right?

295
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:44,000
I've got my 2.5 pro.

296
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,750
Right. Let's do it.

297
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,000
Only came out recently.

298
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,708
Eventually this will move out,

299
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:51,708
you know, hopefully to, GA.

300
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,875
But for now,

301
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,208
we've got internal access to it.

302
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,416
GitHub. So why not?

303
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,083
All right.

304
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,083
I think what I'm going to do

305
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,208
is I'm just going to highlight

306
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,000
the readme to give it focus.

307
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,750
And then I'm just going to say

308
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,458
implement this.

309
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:06,541
Oh type.

310
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,000
That's very

311
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,583
I'm going to I'm

312
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:09,500
going to do the same thing.

313
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,750
I've never been so like two words.

314
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,708
Let's see what happens.

315
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:17,125
Well I'm able to do this okay.

316
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:20,125
So boop.

317
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:25,375
All right.

318
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,000
So so far already.

319
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,750
You know you can see

320
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,916
code is already like writing stuff

321
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:30,833
like it's. Yeah.

322
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,083
And it's telling me, of course,

323
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:33,083
what to use for references,

324
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:34,500
which is just the copilot instructions

325
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,625
for now. Right.

326
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:37,416
So, Claude,

327
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,041
it looks like he's

328
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,708
going right to building. Yes.

329
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:43,583
LS 2.5 Pro is kind of giving me

330
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:44,583
a description.

331
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,750
A pretty heavy description

332
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,000
of what it's plan it's going to be.

333
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,625
Not going to lie, I'm liking what Gemini

334
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,791
2.5 Pro did before

335
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,583
it went into that terminal command.

336
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:56,750
Right. Yeah.

337
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,166
And you know I always like to point out

338
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,541
with these two

339
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,541
you're about to hit continue right there.

340
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,166
Copilot can access the terminal,

341
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,958
but only when you give it permission to.

342
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,250
So it's not gonna, like, run off

343
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,583
and do a whole bunch of stuff

344
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,666
on your machine without you asking.

345
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:11,791
It's going to pause there and say,

346
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:12,500
okay, this is the command

347
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,125
I want to execute.

348
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,416
Do I have permission to go ahead?

349
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,583
I think that's hugely important.

350
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,291
I think so too.

351
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:18,625
All right.

352
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,541
So we're both seeing here we've got

353
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:22,833
we've got files that are appearing.

354
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:23,208
Yeah.

355
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:26,333
And we've got the option to keep or undo

356
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,333
any of those individually.

357
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,458
But also,

358
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,875
to keep or undo them in unmasks.

359
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,541
Right.

360
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,541
So I'm liking what it's built so far

361
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,916
and I'm going to keep those, but,

362
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:43,666
no, I know, so Clyde is still going in

363
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,875
Gemini Star

364
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,166
GPT why is why does that happen?

365
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,250
It's in preview mode.

366
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,291
So hey, you know the the hosting.

367
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,125
This is one of the reason

368
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,416
we dogfood things

369
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:54,375
internally, right,

370
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,666
is because sometimes they break

371
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,166
and we have to figure out why.

372
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,000
I have seen this happen before,

373
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,833
and I have a feeling it's

374
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:01,958
because, you know,

375
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,458
we have certain internal quotas

376
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:04,625
and that sort of thing that we can use.

377
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,166
So I might have hit it, but,

378
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,500
I can actually just try

379
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,166
telling it to continue

380
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:11,375
and see if it's able to

381
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,666
pick up from where it was.

382
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,708
Maybe. Okay.

383
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,416
If not, I mean,

384
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,875
and this is one of those things

385
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:18,833
with the gentle coding, right?

386
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,333
It builds so much stuff,

387
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,333
I I'd be afraid

388
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,458
if it didn't work here and continue.

389
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,750
I could just undo all of these,

390
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,875
wipe it all out.

391
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:29,625
I still got my read

392
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:32,291
me there and just start over and it's

393
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:33,458
back.

394
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:34,750
Just choose a different agent

395
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,791
and go again, right?

396
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,666
Exactly.

397
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:41,333
So I'm still working.

398
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,666
Claude is still going.

399
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:43,500
It's going nuts. Let's.

400
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:43,958
Let's watch.

401
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,791
Cheers for what it looks like

402
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,333
Gemini spinning back up

403
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,166
and so set up for a while.

404
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,750
So now Claude has started the server

405
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,041
like it's.

406
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,083
Oh, you're actually at the point

407
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,875
of executing right now. That's great.

408
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,416
All right, what do we got?

409
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:01,416
Okay, I'll just open.

410
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:02,125
I'm gonna try.

411
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,291
I see we've got an,

412
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:08,291
python at the top.

413
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:11,250
Like, in the data Json structure.

414
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:11,583
We asked it

415
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,375
to make a single main.js

416
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,583
and a single index HTML.

417
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,583
I'm going to guess for now.

418
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:17,083
It probably put

419
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:19,375
the CSS embedded in the HTML,

420
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:20,708
or it's just using the base

421
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:21,708
tailwind styling.

422
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,125
I don't know.

423
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,666
Yeah. Let's try it out.

424
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:28,458
It's keeps opening in the wrong

425
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:29,708
browser window.

426
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:34,583
So I'm just going to copy paste here.

427
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,541
All right.

428
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:41,958
We can't.

429
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,666
Yeah.

430
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:47,416
Let's see.

431
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:50,041
Okay I need to zoom in here to see

432
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,333
unexpected token.

433
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:52,750
See the end here in

434
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:56,416
that CSS should not be used in okay.

435
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:57,833
So I'm not too worried about that.

436
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,458
I actually saw that during testing.

437
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:00,041
And it's basically

438
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,000
just because we're doing unexpected

439
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,750
like loading and tailwind.

440
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,125
So it's actually this one.

441
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,000
It's actually that one.

442
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,916
Yeah. Yeah. All right.

443
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,625
Well I mean this gives us a chance to

444
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:10,291
to show off

445
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,791
one of our favorite things about copilot.

446
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:12,000
Right.

447
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,041
Which is when you hit a bug like this,

448
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:15,791
you can just ask it

449
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,125
what's going on and have it. Yeah.

450
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,166
A solution,

451
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,666
exactly what I was going to do.

452
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:23,666
So I got this error

453
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,750
and then you just paste it.

454
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,416
Something else

455
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:27,708
I like to do is

456
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,291
I like to just like

457
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,583
actually take a screenshot

458
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,083
and just paste it.

459
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,666
Oh, nice. Yes.

460
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,291
And then just pop it in and. Yeah.

461
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,916
Claude does take that visual input.

462
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:39,416
So like,

463
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:41,083
if you're using like,

464
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,791
I think or for mini

465
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,916
or for mini does not take visual input

466
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,083
and you'll see it by like

467
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,208
like it crosses it out out there

468
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:49,875
to indicate like inaugural.

469
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,958
I cannot see that.

470
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,000
Oh that is so cool.

471
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I hadn't noticed that little UI change.

472
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,875
We should probably point out

473
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:58,583
to people too.

474
00:12:58,583 --> 00:12:59,083
I bet a lot of

475
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,125
folks are used to dragging

476
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:00,708
and dropping

477
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,208
from their file tree

478
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:05,041
in vs code into the chat.

479
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,291
But the files

480
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,833
you drop in as you just demonstrate

481
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:08,666
don't actually have to be

482
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:09,416
in your project.

483
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,375
Like you can pull a file

484
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,208
from anywhere on your computer,

485
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:16,666
drag, drop it onto the the chat window,

486
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,958
and that's going to make it

487
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:21,583
available to the interaction.

488
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:21,791
All right.

489
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,916
So you've been doing all this.

490
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,541
Gemini has finally gotten to the point

491
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,166
where I can run now.

492
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:26,625
All right.

493
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:27,291
So it's setting up

494
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,333
my virtual environment.

495
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,250
Yay.

496
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,875
It's built a whole bunch of files.

497
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:34,833
That's I

498
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:35,583
call out

499
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:36,458
because I

500
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,208
don't believe

501
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:40,000
could set up a virtual environment.

502
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,875
unless it did, and I.

503
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:44,625
I was just vibing too hard.

504
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:47,625
I think,

505
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:49,500
yeah, it did.

506
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,000
It's right here.

507
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,541
Okay.

508
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:52,791
So it's one of the first things

509
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,458
that it did was to create that.

510
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,083
Okay.

511
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:56,333
All right.

512
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,125
So someone thinks it's done

513
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:58,750
but I didn't see it.

514
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,708
Okay. Execute.

515
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,458
What I'm going to do though, I know it's

516
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:05,916
12 told me what I have to do. Right.

517
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:06,916
So I'm just going to go

518
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,958
into a new terminal window

519
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,958
and I'm just going to execute,

520
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:16,708
so I'll activate my virtual environment

521
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,708
and then I'll fire a python.

522
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,125
Come on, little terminal. What?

523
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,583
Don't you love me

524
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,958
so, so far while you're doing that, I.

525
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,916
You can see why I tend to stick with

526
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,166
cloud 3.5 on it.

527
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,833
Because for me, I get the best ones.

528
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,833
I've been getting the best results using.

529
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:36,833
Quote 3.5.

530
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:37,500
You know,

531
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,916
and that is what I tend to use a lot.

532
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,625
I think part of it is like it's

533
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:43,791
just the right balance

534
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,583
of like speed, precision.

535
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:48,333
Right. Okay, there we go.

536
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,083
All right.

537
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,875
Because, yeah, like, I don't know.

538
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:51,208
We'll see

539
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,458
if Gemini's result is a lot better,

540
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:53,958
I don't know.

541
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:56,333
Oh, does it load on the first try?

542
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:57,125
Yeah.

543
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,166
Okay.

544
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,458
Oh, I just didn't,

545
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:00,208
I didn't do

546
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:00,791
my pep,

547
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:03,250
requirements install, that's all.

548
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,791
Fortunately,

549
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,250
I know, I know what that is, so.

550
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,125
Okay, actually, though,

551
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:07,791
I'm going to do it

552
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,958
the right way, right at the right way,

553
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,541
which is, I like to

554
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:12,750
I like to trust my, brain.

555
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,833
I know what it does.

556
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:14,750
But at the same time,

557
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,750
I like to see how the model reacts.

558
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:18,791
Yeah. Okay.

559
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,291
So I'm going to feed it back that error

560
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:21,041
and hopefully it tells me

561
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,083
I need to do a pip3

562
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,375
install of the requirements

563
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,583
file or something like that.

564
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:26,541
Uhhuh.

565
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:29,541
No, no. Okay. What.

566
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:29,916
All right.

567
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,916
Well.

568
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:34,458
I know

569
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:37,458
I'll check what we have here.

570
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:40,666
Yeah.

571
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,291
Did I resolve the error?

572
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:45,041
I did not okay,

573
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:47,500
so we might have a little bit of a

574
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,750
more debugging to do.

575
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,708
One did it,

576
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:53,375
did it save the file after it changed it?

577
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,916
Yeah. It did. Okay.

578
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:56,958
So I've had that problem

579
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,416
occasionally where

580
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,250
there's a, there's a

581
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,291
I guess the viewers should know,

582
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,583
there's the keep step.

583
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,166
But sometimes you also have

584
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,625
to manually save the file

585
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:10,458
or do a save all I found,

586
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,583
just to actually get it down to disk.

587
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:15,583
Yeah. It's all saved.

588
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,125
Yeah.

589
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,083
We kind of want to see

590
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,750
what the model can do. So.

591
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,291
Okay, while you're doing that,

592
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,875
I've got mine spun up.

593
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,791
So let's take a look. All.

594
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:29,291
This is fun.

595
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,000
Oh, did all of this gives me

596
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,958
an opportunity to talk about this?

597
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,958
By the way, since it's here, it's like,

598
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,541
So Cassidy recently wrote a great blog

599
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,166
post called which I models

600
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,083
I use with GitHub Copilot. Right.

601
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,833
So you're watching this gem here,

602
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:46,041
but if you want like her opinions

603
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,916
about what models are good for,

604
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,875
what she's got a nice little Tldr

605
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:50,541
breakdown

606
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,625
and then talking about each one, right?

607
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,208
Let's see, let's see.

608
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:54,875
All right. Okay.

609
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,208
So so close.

610
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,625
I know the witnesses, though. Okay, cool.

611
00:16:59,625 --> 00:16:59,916
You know,

612
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,250
and I'll we'll see what

613
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,125
it we'll see what it does

614
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,500
when I give it the input.

615
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,125
But,

616
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:08,125
just to talk through that for viewers,

617
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:08,958
Jinja is,

618
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,500
generally server

619
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,500
side templating language,

620
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:16,541
and it uses a very similar syntax

621
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:19,708
to, what Vue.js does.

622
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:22,291
So when you just dump them

623
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,083
both into a single file,

624
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,708
it can be a little confusing

625
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,083
for the interpreters

626
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:27,833
as to which thing it's

627
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,875
supposed to interpret in which context.

628
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,083
So it'll probably have to do

629
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,833
some escaping here. Yeah.

630
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:36,916
To protect, the server side,

631
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:40,875
rendering engine from the components

632
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,125
that are only supposed to be interpreted

633
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:45,125
on the front end by Vue, I see.

634
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,250
Okay, there we go.

635
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,958
So yeah, it's it's it's wrapping.

636
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,750
It's going to wrap some stuff in raw.

637
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,958
It looks like.

638
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:55,916
And let's I

639
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,208
don't know if I need to reload or not.

640
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:01,208
Let's see if that takes.

641
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,708
Yes.

642
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,708
Oh my goodness.

643
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:07,666
All right.

644
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:11,625
And, so so I have the same error.

645
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,166
I'm so impressed. Okay.

646
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:16,166
So Gemini was able to, to do it

647
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,208
and it resolved

648
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:21,000
whatever error you had on the first go.

649
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Meanwhile, like quad cloudy Tokyo

650
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:27,500
has been has not been able to identify

651
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,375
the unexpected

652
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:31,916
token on line 131 in Main.js right.

653
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,250
Is this one of these places

654
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:34,750
where we need.

655
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,375
And that's the actual line, right?

656
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:37,458
Yeah, this is the line.

657
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,625
So I'm kind of looking to see

658
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,625
I could also change the model.

659
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,875
Yeah, yeah.

660
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,708
Opportunity for us to find out.

661
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,708
Which one should I use?

662
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,375
Oh, well,

663
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,500
I mean, two fives when performing well,

664
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,875
but we've also kind of shown it off

665
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:58,291
three, seven.

666
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,750
I know I was going to go,

667
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,916
I was going to go three seven thinking.

668
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,541
And now we can ask. Right.

669
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:03,916
Okay.

670
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:06,250
We can say like what is wrong with this?

671
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,166
What is wrong with the highlighted line.

672
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:08,458
Yeah.

673
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:10,583
And maybe we give it

674
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:11,625
the, the error message.

675
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:14,625
We're saying, yeah, okay.

676
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,500
All right.

677
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,500
Let's see.

678
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,416
And so let's see.

679
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,541
So it's referencing the instructions

680
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:33,541
and then it references Main.js.

681
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:34,791
All right.

682
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,083
So it's thinking you know

683
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:39,000
thinking takes time. It does.

684
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,166
But you know it's crazy.

685
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,125
Like sometimes

686
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:42,541
I feel like the models are slow,

687
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,458
but are they slow?

688
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:45,750
I don't think so.

689
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,333
I think it's just like we're impatient.

690
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:47,916
Impatient?

691
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,958
We want wanted to be like a microwave.

692
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:50,333
We've gotten

693
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,291
so used to having our answers right now.

694
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,500
I don't

695
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,375
if I could build this much this quickly

696
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:59,791
20 years ago, I would have been listen,

697
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,125
craziness.

698
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:02,750
Okay.

699
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,166
All right. Okay.

700
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,291
Now, what I love about this is,

701
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:07,875
unlike the others,

702
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:08,666
which are just like,

703
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:09,791
okay, I'll rewrite it,

704
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,250
and they kind of give a brief,

705
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,583
a deep explanation.

706
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:14,666
So now

707
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:15,166
it's saying it's

708
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:16,541
because there is a space,

709
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,416
but I just added this space.

710
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:23,125
So, remove the problematic space,

711
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,083
adds a formatting method

712
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,541
for better maintainability.

713
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:27,791
All right.

714
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,333
I'm just going to do this.

715
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,583
How about that?

716
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:35,333
Oh, if I do apply an editor from here.

717
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:36,708
Yeah.

718
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:37,208
Let's see

719
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,875
if it will intelligently know

720
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,333
where to apply these changes.

721
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,750
Yeah okay.

722
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,166
What would you have done.

723
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:47,791
You know, probably just because I've,

724
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:48,958
I've seen this a couple times.

725
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,333
Probably I would have asked it

726
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,125
if room dot price

727
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,833
is actually a valid variable

728
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,333
like it's awesome.

729
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,708
Price isn't in the data model.

730
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,916
And so sometimes I've seen syntax errors

731
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,458
where it really should be telling you

732
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:03,416
price doesn't exist.

733
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:03,875
But inside is

734
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,458
just like the dot is invalid

735
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,750
because it doesn't know how to descend.

736
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,000
I was going to say

737
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,375
I would expect a different error

738
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:11,666
if it wasn't a valid.

739
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:12,833
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

740
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,666
So that I mean that's just conjecture.

741
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,041
I don't know for sure,

742
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,166
but I like this because it actually

743
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,333
we'll see whether it's able

744
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,375
to call that format price

745
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,083
method properly.

746
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,333
So we'll know whether it's actually

747
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,083
getting through the template.

748
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,000
Let's saying,

749
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,583
you know this is my first time using Vue

750
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:31,166
as well.

751
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,333
I, I have not touched

752
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,375
feeling a little while,

753
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,500
which seems like it's, it's yeah.

754
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,250
Persisting.

755
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,000
can you click on into the main

756
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
JS line one.

757
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,291
Yeah. That's a good.

758
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,083
Yeah. It's the same one thing.

759
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,541
One. It's not clear in the cache.

760
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,125
That's our whole problem.

761
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:50,541
And this is, this is where the I'm

762
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,125
is they don't have full awareness

763
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,333
of what's going on.

764
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:58,000
We still have to think, I don't know.

765
00:21:58,541 --> 00:21:59,833
We can just ask it.

766
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:00,791
We can just say, like,

767
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:02,416
it looks like the browser's

768
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:04,333
and clearing the cache. Yeah.

769
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,083
Oh, you want me to ask it?

770
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:06,416
Yeah.

771
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:07,708
I just want to see because, like,

772
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:08,916
okay, in case

773
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:10,583
developers haven't used this before,

774
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:14,083
if you're in dev mode in Chrome,

775
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,291
if you are here, console open right

776
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,916
then when you control

777
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:19,333
hold down that refresh button.

778
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:22,666
What what you just showed

779
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:25,208
is that refresh button on Chrome

780
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:26,500
has extra options.

781
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,958
It's got the extra empty relived.

782
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:30,333
But can we get

783
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:31,625
can we get them all to know that

784
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:32,208
that's true

785
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:34,250
and to let's see let's find out.

786
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:34,791
So what do you

787
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:37,375
what do you suggest I put here.

788
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:38,541
Something like

789
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:41,458
it looks like the pages and changing.

790
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:43,708
Even though we've saved it,

791
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:46,625
the browser still has the old template

792
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:47,500
or something like that.

793
00:22:58,541 --> 00:22:59,875
Let's see.

794
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:02,875
I wonder if you're thinking,

795
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:08,250
Think for me.

796
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,291
Glad you know what?

797
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:13,000
I'm going to say the same thing in mind.

798
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,750
Okay,

799
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,375
so that was

800
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:17,375
I was going to say, I want to say, yeah.

801
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:20,291
So let's see, who should I do this with?

802
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:23,375
Let's go into ask mode and I'll pick.

803
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,208
You know what?

804
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:27,333
Let's go with Copilot Base right now

805
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:29,833
in case in case

806
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:30,750
we're playing around

807
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,500
with naming conventions and stuff.

808
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,291
This is internal only I think right now

809
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:38,291
copilot base goes to like, or one

810
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:41,166
I think 4.1. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

811
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:42,791
So this is really for one responding

812
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:45,458
just so viewers now it's fine

813
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:48,458
for template.

814
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:56,916
But you know, this is

815
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:58,583
this is also proving that,

816
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:01,125
you know, when you take time to think

817
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:03,375
through your process logically,

818
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,416
write down all your steps

819
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:05,416
of what you're going to do,

820
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:07,333
you'll get better results. Right?

821
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:09,583
Because Gemini 2.5

822
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:11,416
went into thinking, planning

823
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:12,875
and then started coding.

824
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:16,416
Club 3.5 said yes,

825
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:18,791
okay, I'm gonna do it here. Go.

826
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,291
Right. Yeah.

827
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:21,458
It was it's interesting.

828
00:24:21,458 --> 00:24:22,208
And you know,

829
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:23,291
I don't get me wrong,

830
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:26,208
I've had great success with cloud 3.5.

831
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:28,333
Yes, it is more limited.

832
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:30,000
It doesn't go as deep.

833
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,583
It doesn't give

834
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:32,000
as much of a reasoning step

835
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,083
ahead of time.

836
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:34,333
And it sometimes

837
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:36,416
feels like for very complex cases,

838
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:38,166
I still need a bigger model.

839
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:40,833
all right okay.

840
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:41,666
So you got some results.

841
00:24:41,666 --> 00:24:42,458
I've got some results.

842
00:24:42,458 --> 00:24:45,083
Good.

843
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,125
Then refresh the browser.

844
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:47,625
See the changes aren't showing up

845
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:50,625
because you modified the source file.

846
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:51,083
Okay.

847
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:51,958
And then what's your step

848
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:53,666
by step solution.

849
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:55,583
Okay. This change looks identical.

850
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:56,041
This is great.

851
00:24:56,041 --> 00:24:58,958
So boom 437 I'm looking in GPG for one.

852
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:00,458
They both said okay.

853
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:02,250
First make sure that the changes

854
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,000
are actually there

855
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,125
and copy

856
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:05,666
your your main JS file

857
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:08,625
into the static directory. Yeah.

858
00:25:08,625 --> 00:25:09,875
And then does

859
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,041
your give us the commands to copy

860
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:13,833
for Windows and Mac.

861
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:16,291
Very very good. Okay.

862
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,500
Then it says refresh

863
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,541
your browser browser.

864
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:20,916
Yeah.

865
00:25:20,916 --> 00:25:23,166
And in mine it gives me a hard refresh.

866
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:23,875
You know.

867
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:24,541
Oh nice.

868
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:28,416
Okay. Yours does.

869
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:29,708
And then it gives me,

870
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:30,666
give me some like, you know,

871
00:25:30,666 --> 00:25:33,333
you can set up a file watcher.

872
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:33,625
All right.

873
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:36,041
So let's clear cache and see.

874
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:39,541
But that was good that so three

875
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:42,541
seven did not say clear cache

876
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:43,625
okay.

877
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:44,291
But maybe it's

878
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:46,500
maybe that earlier step is the right one

879
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,458
that maybe the

880
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:49,000
the copying it into the static.

881
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,291
Maybe that's not

882
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:51,458
actually maybe that's

883
00:25:51,458 --> 00:25:53,333
not a bad suggestion.

884
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:55,541
So which I could see because,

885
00:25:55,541 --> 00:25:56,041
you know, again,

886
00:25:56,041 --> 00:25:57,208
we're not really running this

887
00:25:57,208 --> 00:25:57,708
the right way.

888
00:25:57,708 --> 00:25:58,666
We're not running with the build

889
00:25:58,666 --> 00:26:00,333
step on the front end. Yeah.

890
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:01,416
This is why it's using the

891
00:26:01,416 --> 00:26:02,583
static directory. I think.

892
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:09,208
So copied.

893
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,708
There we go.

894
00:26:13,708 --> 00:26:15,875
Oh, yeah.

895
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:17,875
Oh, right. Okay.

896
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:20,083
So we don't know which step

897
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:21,208
which was the right.

898
00:26:21,208 --> 00:26:23,541
I think it was somewhere in there.

899
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:24,833
I think it was the copy

900
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,083
because when I didn't copy

901
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:28,250
and I was just like okay,

902
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,416
you didn't tell me to.

903
00:26:29,416 --> 00:26:30,458
You didn't tell me to clear cache.

904
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:32,250
Let me just clear the cache.

905
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,833
Clear in the cache did not work.

906
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:34,458
It's after

907
00:26:34,458 --> 00:26:35,208
I copied

908
00:26:35,208 --> 00:26:37,916
and clear the cache that it worked.

909
00:26:37,916 --> 00:26:40,916
So it actually solve the issue.

910
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,875
It did solve the issue.

911
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:44,583
That's awesome.

912
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:48,333
And, it's advice on, like,

913
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:49,916
how to clear the cache.

914
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:51,250
Yes, how to fix it

915
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,083
turns out to both have been right.

916
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:54,291
Turns out to both have been right.

917
00:26:54,291 --> 00:26:55,750
So thank you.

918
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,250
So,

919
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,208
by the way, that you were asking

920
00:26:58,208 --> 00:26:59,208
about debugging, right.

921
00:26:59,208 --> 00:27:00,041
And it did

922
00:27:00,041 --> 00:27:01,208
a good answer to said, okay,

923
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:01,833
you can set flask

924
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:04,166
debug in your env file, which.

925
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:05,750
Right.

926
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,041
So I'm just asking it,

927
00:27:07,041 --> 00:27:07,375
can I do it

928
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,875
without setting anything in the file?

929
00:27:08,875 --> 00:27:10,625
And those results suck.

930
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:11,833
So if there is a

931
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:15,333
dash up on the command on the actual same

932
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,333
line, it it doesn't know.

933
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:18,875
All right.

934
00:27:18,875 --> 00:27:20,541
Okay. So we both have a working app.

935
00:27:20,541 --> 00:27:22,666
Awesome. Awesome.

936
00:27:22,666 --> 00:27:23,750
they actually look really,

937
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,041
really similar, right?

938
00:27:25,041 --> 00:27:26,375
They actually do slightly

939
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:28,791
different data assumptions, but whatever.

940
00:27:28,791 --> 00:27:30,375
And I assume a lot of that's

941
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:32,041
just because it's like basic tailwind

942
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:33,125
styling, right?

943
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:33,875
Yeah.

944
00:27:33,875 --> 00:27:36,375
And look, I have some price here.

945
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:36,875
Oh yeah.

946
00:27:36,875 --> 00:27:39,875
Very interesting.

947
00:27:39,916 --> 00:27:41,916
So let's see room.

948
00:27:41,916 --> 00:27:44,041
Let's see if we can book anything.

949
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:45,541
Yeah.

950
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:46,708
The date picker.

951
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:48,708
Does it work? Okay.

952
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,333
I mean, just using like the same.

953
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:51,166
Yeah. The same. Yeah.

954
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:53,125
It's the same style. Yeah.

955
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:54,375
Which is good because.

956
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:57,083
Oh, reservation created successfully.

957
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:58,958
Yay. All right. Yep.

958
00:27:58,958 --> 00:28:00,500
Did it for me.

959
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,791
Weird that it's using the numbers

960
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:07,000
for the results, but, Oh, interesting.

961
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,291
also interesting that the ID

962
00:28:08,291 --> 00:28:11,208
is showing up on the UI, right.

963
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:13,166
Which like, it should be.

964
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:14,333
Okay. So let's let's do it.

965
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:15,333
Let's let's fix it up.

966
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:15,875
Because,

967
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:17,166
you know, what we've shown here

968
00:28:17,166 --> 00:28:18,666
is actually a fairly unusual case.

969
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:20,708
Like most developers,

970
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:22,083
they're they're working on brownfield,

971
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:23,916
the recount stuff that's already there,

972
00:28:23,916 --> 00:28:25,000
not Greenfield

973
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
building an app from scratch. True.

974
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,666
You only do that once in theory,

975
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:30,083
in the lifetime of an app.

976
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,333
So I like this idea

977
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:33,750
of now we should refine it. Right.

978
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,958
So I could say something like, hey,

979
00:28:34,958 --> 00:28:37,500
the IDs aren't shouldn't be showing.

980
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,083
And then I like the ear shows price,

981
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:42,416
so I'll ask it that too.

982
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:42,750
Okay.

983
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:45,833
You know what?

984
00:28:45,833 --> 00:28:47,208
Let let's try out.

985
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:49,291
Let's try, copilot based GPT for one.

986
00:28:49,291 --> 00:28:49,750
It did so

987
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,958
well on the first step,

988
00:28:51,958 --> 00:28:53,791
I'm going to go into edit mode.

989
00:28:53,791 --> 00:28:55,291
I think it's what I'm going to do.

990
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:55,666
All right

991
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:57,750
I'll follow your then edit mode.

992
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,000
Oh.

993
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
If I go to edit mode

994
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,583
let me hit done edit mode okay.

995
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:04,833
What are we doing. What are we doing.

996
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:06,458
So I'm going to I'm going to ask it

997
00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:09,000
to remove the IDs okay.

998
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,083
Add the price okay.

999
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,166
Go ahead okay.

1000
00:29:12,166 --> 00:29:12,458
All right.

1001
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:13,750
So I'm going to I'm going to grab

1002
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,291
basically just

1003
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:15,875
everything I think

1004
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:16,750
is going to be relevant.

1005
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,208
Like I don't think

1006
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:18,666
the env matters for this,

1007
00:29:18,666 --> 00:29:20,625
but probably the static

1008
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,416
the templates are going to be important

1009
00:29:22,416 --> 00:29:23,958
that the change log obviously

1010
00:29:23,958 --> 00:29:25,750
while the data makes it

1011
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,916
I don't know if it has price in there.

1012
00:29:28,791 --> 00:29:29,916
And I

1013
00:29:29,916 --> 00:29:31,000
wonder if I include the readme,

1014
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,916
I wonder if it'll adjust the read me.

1015
00:29:32,916 --> 00:29:36,000
So okay, all of those into my context.

1016
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:38,916
So I before you keep going,

1017
00:29:38,916 --> 00:29:39,666
I want to call this out.

1018
00:29:39,666 --> 00:29:42,125
So with eight with with edit mode,

1019
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:42,750
it's important

1020
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,041
to drag your files

1021
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:46,333
into the context window.

1022
00:29:46,333 --> 00:29:47,750
Edit mode is going to iterate

1023
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:48,625
through anything.

1024
00:29:48,625 --> 00:29:52,125
I've given it as context, but unlike

1025
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:53,250
agent mode

1026
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,208
which like will automatically expand

1027
00:29:55,208 --> 00:29:56,000
the context, right?

1028
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,875
I don't think edit mode

1029
00:29:57,875 --> 00:29:59,333
auto expands context.

1030
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:00,541
I think that's

1031
00:30:00,541 --> 00:30:00,791
yeah,

1032
00:30:00,791 --> 00:30:02,208
I think that's why I'm calling it out.

1033
00:30:02,208 --> 00:30:03,875
So I just want, you know,

1034
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:05,041
if you're when you're watching this,

1035
00:30:05,041 --> 00:30:05,666
I want you to know

1036
00:30:05,666 --> 00:30:07,500
that when you're using edit mode,

1037
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,833
you have to give it access

1038
00:30:08,833 --> 00:30:09,625
to those files

1039
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:10,500
and folders

1040
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,916
that you wanted to be able to edit.

1041
00:30:12,916 --> 00:30:15,541
Otherwise, I don't think it finds it

1042
00:30:15,541 --> 00:30:17,416
automagically. Right?

1043
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:18,333
I don't think so.

1044
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:19,375
Yeah, I don't think so.

1045
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:20,375
And that's intentional.

1046
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:22,000
Okay.

1047
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,041
Cool. So yeah, that context matters.

1048
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:24,875
There we go.

1049
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:27,875
I should

1050
00:30:28,041 --> 00:30:28,333
yeah.

1051
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:29,958
And also at workspace

1052
00:30:29,958 --> 00:30:30,833
doesn't work, right.

1053
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:33,333
We can show that in in ask mode,

1054
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:34,625
but in ask mode,

1055
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:35,583
if you just want to include

1056
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,833
everything you can say at workspace.

1057
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:38,333
And it's

1058
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:39,166
basically give it access

1059
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:39,875
to all the files

1060
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:42,250
inside the VS code workspace.

1061
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,583
Edit mode that's not available.

1062
00:30:43,583 --> 00:30:45,208
It's explicit addition

1063
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:47,750
as you said of the file. Okay.

1064
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,500
So I'm just going to tell to do things

1065
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,458
like let's

1066
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:54,458
improve this up

1067
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:56,333
one.

1068
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:59,666
Remove the reservation

1069
00:31:00,833 --> 00:31:03,833
IDs.

1070
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:06,833
The front end.

1071
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,208
Just and say page

1072
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:13,416
and let me be explicit

1073
00:31:13,416 --> 00:31:15,458
and say the visible IDs

1074
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:16,458
like I don't want to do anything

1075
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:17,250
like remove

1076
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,750
the IDs and I have to infer what they

1077
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,458
are on the back end. Right,

1078
00:31:22,416 --> 00:31:23,000
right.

1079
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,708
It's just from the front end page.

1080
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:27,000
Yeah. Exactly. Right.

1081
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,166
To, price to the room

1082
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,625
lists,

1083
00:31:35,625 --> 00:31:38,625
available to the room types.

1084
00:31:42,541 --> 00:31:43,375
Again.

1085
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:44,208
Okay.

1086
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:47,208
Let's see what it does.

1087
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,500
So I can

1088
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,250
we can actually start

1089
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,458
to see what it's doing here. Right.

1090
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:54,208
Like it has a whole bunch of directories

1091
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:55,458
available as well as specific files.

1092
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:55,958
So you can see it's

1093
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:58,000
even searching for explicitly

1094
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,958
like where it reservations,

1095
00:31:59,958 --> 00:32:02,041
where the residents of those

1096
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:02,291
and then

1097
00:32:02,291 --> 00:32:03,541
including only those

1098
00:32:03,541 --> 00:32:05,500
matching files in the context.

1099
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,125
Yeah, kind of cool.

1100
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:07,958
All right.

1101
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:08,708
So I'm really glad

1102
00:32:08,708 --> 00:32:10,791
I dropped in my data Json.

1103
00:32:10,791 --> 00:32:13,875
We had told it in the read me for now,

1104
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:15,125
we're not using a database,

1105
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:16,208
we're just using a Json file

1106
00:32:16,208 --> 00:32:17,791
because it's simple and easy. Right?

1107
00:32:17,791 --> 00:32:19,375
And we gave it some mock data

1108
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:19,791
and I,

1109
00:32:19,791 --> 00:32:20,791
I in the read

1110
00:32:20,791 --> 00:32:23,791
me maybe I didn't actually include price

1111
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:26,583
in there and just see.

1112
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:27,000
Yeah.

1113
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,416
So so it like your model inferred it.

1114
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:32,250
But mine decided not to add that

1115
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:32,916
because I didn't see it

1116
00:32:32,916 --> 00:32:33,541
initially in there.

1117
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:35,041
So now it's actually adding it to that

1118
00:32:35,041 --> 00:32:36,458
Json structure.

1119
00:32:36,458 --> 00:32:37,583
Nice.

1120
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:40,375
It's helpfully added a changelog entry

1121
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,500
as we asked it too. Nice.

1122
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,666
Oh yeah, the changelog.

1123
00:32:44,666 --> 00:32:49,208
It's putting the price into the the HTML

1124
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:51,125
right there. Great.

1125
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:54,375
And it's updated the JavaScript.

1126
00:32:55,125 --> 00:32:55,750
I don't actually see

1127
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,125
any changes in there.

1128
00:32:57,125 --> 00:32:57,791
That's interesting

1129
00:32:57,791 --> 00:32:59,333
because I think there would be well,

1130
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:01,500
there isn't a full ORM here,

1131
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,416
but I wonder if we're gonna

1132
00:33:02,416 --> 00:33:05,208
run into a problem. Where is price? Not?

1133
00:33:06,541 --> 00:33:07,416
We may have to come back

1134
00:33:07,416 --> 00:33:08,416
and do something manually.

1135
00:33:08,416 --> 00:33:08,916
I don't know,

1136
00:33:08,916 --> 00:33:13,416
I see, I'll keep this and just reload

1137
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:16,416
there.

1138
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:17,583
Okay.

1139
00:33:17,583 --> 00:33:18,416
No. It's good.

1140
00:33:18,416 --> 00:33:22,166
So we got a price, for both of them.

1141
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,083
And the IDs are gone.

1142
00:33:24,083 --> 00:33:25,250
Perfect. Exactly. What?

1143
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:25,958
Yeah,

1144
00:33:25,958 --> 00:33:26,500
I actually

1145
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,041
like how your UI is styled better,

1146
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:31,750
because I would much rather

1147
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,708
this cancel button

1148
00:33:32,708 --> 00:33:34,833
to be on the side over here.

1149
00:33:34,833 --> 00:33:35,875
I think that's pretty

1150
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:37,625
standard in industry.

1151
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:39,000
And I don't know, something

1152
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,833
about the space thing.

1153
00:33:40,833 --> 00:33:42,416
And

1154
00:33:42,416 --> 00:33:43,500
I don't know, there's something

1155
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:43,958
that I'm

1156
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:45,708
I'm vibing with

1157
00:33:45,708 --> 00:33:47,875
more on your page than this.

1158
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:50,666
We can try this. Right.

1159
00:33:50,666 --> 00:33:51,625
We were talking about

1160
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:53,416
visual inputs, right.

1161
00:33:53,416 --> 00:33:54,666
You can see my screen.

1162
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:56,375
Do you want to see us?

1163
00:33:56,375 --> 00:33:57,958
And that. All right,

1164
00:33:59,458 --> 00:34:01,625
let's see.

1165
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:05,166
Because another call out I had was,

1166
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:11,041
this model did not, I lost a screenshot.

1167
00:34:11,041 --> 00:34:12,208
I'll just do it again.

1168
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:13,125
It did not include

1169
00:34:13,125 --> 00:34:14,708
anything in the changelog.

1170
00:34:14,708 --> 00:34:16,291
It's not doing it.

1171
00:34:16,291 --> 00:34:19,083
It did not do it.

1172
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:21,750
That's right.

1173
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:25,291
Now I wonder why should we?

1174
00:34:25,291 --> 00:34:26,500
Should we try one other thing

1175
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,666
while you're working?

1176
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:28,583
Yeah, sure.

1177
00:34:28,583 --> 00:34:29,625
It's actually reading

1178
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:30,875
the copilot instructions.

1179
00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:32,875
Right.

1180
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:34,166
We could put something like

1181
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:36,291
talk like a pirate at the top

1182
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:38,500
so that we can actually see the action

1183
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,500
that is obeying the copilot instructions.

1184
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:48,000
But it was.

1185
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,333
You see the suggestion,

1186
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:50,625
follow the instructions.

1187
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:52,416
Yes,

1188
00:34:52,416 --> 00:34:54,166
but with a focus on code quality

1189
00:34:54,166 --> 00:34:55,083
and maintainability.

1190
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:56,458
Why not?

1191
00:34:56,458 --> 00:34:58,833
Why not?

1192
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:00,958
But, Yeah, let's see

1193
00:35:00,958 --> 00:35:02,166
if it's actually doing that.

1194
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:04,500
And hopefully I understand,

1195
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,416
the language.

1196
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:09,791
Just a little.

1197
00:35:09,791 --> 00:35:10,208
So I'm

1198
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,041
going to go to,

1199
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:13,625
I'm just going to go to Agent mode

1200
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:16,666
and I'm gonna screenshot

1201
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,750
your UI.

1202
00:35:20,625 --> 00:35:23,625
And we're going to pop it in here.

1203
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:26,083
And who do we go with.

1204
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:27,875
Do I go,

1205
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:30,625
well let's see, I know Gemini two flash.

1206
00:35:30,625 --> 00:35:33,333
We know Claude 3.5, sonnet and GP2 four.

1207
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:36,500
Oh, well, visual inputs.

1208
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,916
So let's try Gemini.

1209
00:35:38,916 --> 00:35:40,750
Okay.

1210
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,333
And, you know, even Gemini Flash

1211
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:45,083
I think will do. We want to play okay.

1212
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:46,375
Oh, it's not an easy mode.

1213
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:48,166
Of course. Yeah, yeah.

1214
00:35:48,166 --> 00:35:50,083
Sorry. My bad.

1215
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:50,666
No no no.

1216
00:35:50,666 --> 00:35:52,416
So I want to say like what would I say.

1217
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:53,208
Like I think I would just

1218
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:56,500
update UI to reflect the new design.

1219
00:35:57,041 --> 00:35:58,500
I don't know,

1220
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,375
it's not that new,

1221
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:00,958
but that's all I would say.

1222
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:01,750
What would you say?

1223
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:05,833
No, I think that's perfect.

1224
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:08,833
Yeah, but it.

1225
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:09,666
So let's see if it talks

1226
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:10,708
like a parrot to see

1227
00:36:10,708 --> 00:36:13,083
if it's actually you see the reference.

1228
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:15,333
It's saying here.

1229
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:16,458
Yes. I mean right.

1230
00:36:16,458 --> 00:36:18,250
So it says it's pulling it in.

1231
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,250
So how many changes do you have in your,

1232
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,583
changelog? I'm curious.

1233
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:26,833
Great question.

1234
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:28,625
It

1235
00:36:28,625 --> 00:36:29,166
it looks like

1236
00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:30,375
it's been pretty good about it.

1237
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:33,375
Like I've got my initial commit.

1238
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:35,666
I, I wow. Yeah.

1239
00:36:35,666 --> 00:36:37,750
Fixing the ginger problem.

1240
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:39,916
I've got, Whoops.

1241
00:36:39,916 --> 00:36:41,166
Sorry.

1242
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:44,166
I've got.

1243
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,833
Input validation.

1244
00:36:46,833 --> 00:36:47,791
The template change.

1245
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:48,000
Yeah.

1246
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,958
Now it looks it looks complete to me.

1247
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:50,916
Amazing.

1248
00:36:50,916 --> 00:36:52,000
So again,

1249
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,500
I'm not sure

1250
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,166
why it's not updating the changelog here,

1251
00:36:55,166 --> 00:36:57,583
but it is talking like a pirate.

1252
00:36:57,583 --> 00:36:58,291
Ahoy there.

1253
00:36:58,291 --> 00:36:59,833
But I see

1254
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:01,375
you want the UI

1255
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:03,833
to match the design you've shared.

1256
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:04,750
You've shared.

1257
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:07,625
Okay, so it is

1258
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:10,625
doing it good.

1259
00:37:10,791 --> 00:37:11,750
Now this is interesting.

1260
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:12,375
You asked for a

1261
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:13,958
UI change,

1262
00:37:13,958 --> 00:37:16,958
but it's changing the data structure.

1263
00:37:17,541 --> 00:37:19,708
Whoa.

1264
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:20,791
It's going above and beyond,

1265
00:37:20,791 --> 00:37:22,333
but not necessarily in a good way.

1266
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:24,833
Unless you know what it did,

1267
00:37:24,833 --> 00:37:26,583
it's pulling the data out of the

1268
00:37:26,583 --> 00:37:29,208
the design as well as the layout.

1269
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:31,791
Oh, right.

1270
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:32,416
I wonder,

1271
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,375
so we could go with this

1272
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:34,333
and roll with it,

1273
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:35,541
or we could cancel

1274
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:36,625
this run, undo

1275
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:38,666
everything that it's about to change,

1276
00:37:38,666 --> 00:37:41,208
and then say, just change the design,

1277
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:42,625
but not the data.

1278
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:44,625
See if that will be a little bit more.

1279
00:37:44,625 --> 00:37:46,708
I mean, it's doing cool.

1280
00:37:46,708 --> 00:37:49,583
I mean, Gemini 2.5 uses a lot of tokens.

1281
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:52,125
Look at this. Yeah.

1282
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:53,625
Which is something to be aware of right.

1283
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:54,666
Like

1284
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:56,375
and while I don't know

1285
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:58,291
if there's a specific chart for it,

1286
00:37:58,291 --> 00:38:00,083
I know we have certain models marked

1287
00:38:00,083 --> 00:38:02,791
as like premium or using more tokens, but

1288
00:38:02,791 --> 00:38:05,791
I always feel like a good easy proxy for

1289
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:06,916
it is just

1290
00:38:06,916 --> 00:38:08,625
how much output does it give me

1291
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:10,458
and how slow is it?

1292
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:11,333
Yeah, kind of

1293
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:14,125
why that something's taking more energy.

1294
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:14,583
Yes.

1295
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:15,958
It's something just always go

1296
00:38:15,958 --> 00:38:17,208
with the highest power model.

1297
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:18,125
But hey,

1298
00:38:18,125 --> 00:38:20,625
it was just Earth Day recently, right?

1299
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:23,625
So I guess we should add in here

1300
00:38:23,916 --> 00:38:26,208
one way that you can be a little more

1301
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:29,041
eco conscious is go with the lighter

1302
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:29,875
weight models.

1303
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:30,625
When you know that

1304
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:32,500
they're going to be sufficient.

1305
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,583
And the side benefit of that

1306
00:38:33,583 --> 00:38:35,708
is that they're faster. Right.

1307
00:38:35,708 --> 00:38:37,625
And then only going forward

1308
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:39,250
to those heavier models

1309
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,250
like 2.5 Pro, for example, or three seven

1310
00:38:42,458 --> 00:38:43,541
and Claude,

1311
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:45,750
when you really need that horsepower.

1312
00:38:48,583 --> 00:38:51,041
Good call out.

1313
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:51,750
So now I

1314
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:52,708
have to update the UI

1315
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:53,708
to reflect that new design.

1316
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:54,833
Do not change the content,

1317
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,500
just the UI styling.

1318
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,291
Is that sufficient?

1319
00:38:58,291 --> 00:39:00,250
Let's see here.

1320
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,083
Ahoy there matey.

1321
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:03,250
And I missed it while I was talking.

1322
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:03,708
Did you?

1323
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:05,375
You hit undo right on.

1324
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:07,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I even cancel it.

1325
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,291
I stopped and cancel

1326
00:39:08,291 --> 00:39:09,000
and just removed it

1327
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,500
from the context window.

1328
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,500
When you hit cancel, does it auto undo?

1329
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:15,750
No, no, it just stops.

1330
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:18,000
It stops a generation.

1331
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,375
And then I went up and just,

1332
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:23,375
hit the click on this button to remove

1333
00:39:24,166 --> 00:39:25,666
the last request.

1334
00:39:25,666 --> 00:39:28,416
I guess. Okay.

1335
00:39:28,416 --> 00:39:28,833
That's something

1336
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:30,500
I don't really mess around with much too.

1337
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,833
But good, good call out.

1338
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:32,125
Right?

1339
00:39:32,125 --> 00:39:33,041
That like

1340
00:39:33,041 --> 00:39:35,583
when I'm doing things in a session,

1341
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:37,708
keeping the

1342
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:38,708
full history and

1343
00:39:38,708 --> 00:39:39,875
it might, you know, that's my

1344
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:40,833
this session gets long enough.

1345
00:39:40,833 --> 00:39:41,833
It might eventually start

1346
00:39:41,833 --> 00:39:43,416
forgetting some of the older stuff.

1347
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:45,208
But you can go and you can

1348
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:48,333
manually, manually remove elements

1349
00:39:48,333 --> 00:39:51,000
from history by just axing them out.

1350
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,250
Exactly.

1351
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:54,750
And it's also a really good way to remove

1352
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:57,375
any changes that you don't want.

1353
00:39:57,375 --> 00:39:58,583
Because then when you,

1354
00:39:58,583 --> 00:39:59,833
when you remove that request,

1355
00:39:59,833 --> 00:40:00,500
it removes

1356
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,500
all the changes that are adjusted to the.

1357
00:40:03,625 --> 00:40:05,125
It's pretty good.

1358
00:40:05,125 --> 00:40:08,125
Okay.

1359
00:40:08,833 --> 00:40:09,875
Look these changes.

1360
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:12,875
Oh.

1361
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,083
It finally did it.

1362
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:15,541
It's

1363
00:40:15,541 --> 00:40:18,000
it finally did it here.

1364
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,875
All right, all right.

1365
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,458
So what do we got? Okay, good.

1366
00:40:21,458 --> 00:40:22,541
That's file names.

1367
00:40:22,541 --> 00:40:24,125
We got the main JS change

1368
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:26,625
and we updated the changelog. Yep.

1369
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:29,166
But it didn't touch the JS.

1370
00:40:29,166 --> 00:40:30,666
Here we go. All right.

1371
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:32,541
Yes I

1372
00:40:32,541 --> 00:40:35,375
only got it to notice the changelog.

1373
00:40:35,375 --> 00:40:37,791
I have no idea.

1374
00:40:37,791 --> 00:40:40,333
Oh, of.

1375
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:41,416
We swear

1376
00:40:41,416 --> 00:40:43,375
it's it's not passively listening

1377
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:44,625
when you talk about things

1378
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:47,625
unless you press that microphone.

1379
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,125
this UI

1380
00:40:50,125 --> 00:40:51,125
does not look like yours

1381
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:53,458
because this is not blue.

1382
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:56,458
This is not blue.

1383
00:40:56,833 --> 00:40:57,666
Oh, it's not page.

1384
00:40:57,666 --> 00:41:01,375
It did put the button here okay.

1385
00:41:01,791 --> 00:41:03,916
Oh yeah. And it did update like here.

1386
00:41:03,916 --> 00:41:05,166
And I would just as availability

1387
00:41:05,166 --> 00:41:08,166
and price like yours okay.

1388
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:11,291
I want to do something I'm going to add

1389
00:41:11,291 --> 00:41:12,458
a color palette.

1390
00:41:12,458 --> 00:41:14,166
You just gave me such a good idea.

1391
00:41:14,166 --> 00:41:16,625
Oh, I'm going to follow two second.

1392
00:41:16,625 --> 00:41:19,625
Will I find one?

1393
00:41:20,041 --> 00:41:22,250
Hello, finder.

1394
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,833
Yeah. Are.

1395
00:41:23,833 --> 00:41:26,041
I do love this tip though, John,

1396
00:41:26,041 --> 00:41:27,500
of using of having it

1397
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,500
do its own changelog.

1398
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,500
So you can kind of go through

1399
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,375
and see the history of the

1400
00:41:32,375 --> 00:41:33,833
changes made that it made

1401
00:41:34,958 --> 00:41:35,333
it.

1402
00:41:35,333 --> 00:41:37,208
This has helped me up so much.

1403
00:41:37,208 --> 00:41:38,666
Yeah, I love that

1404
00:41:38,666 --> 00:41:40,666
you have a long editing session

1405
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:43,458
and it just flies out of your head.

1406
00:41:43,458 --> 00:41:44,333
All right.

1407
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:47,500
I'm going to stick in edit mode.

1408
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,916
I think the context I used

1409
00:41:49,916 --> 00:41:52,416
last time is actually pretty good.

1410
00:41:52,416 --> 00:41:55,375
I'm going to switch though, to

1411
00:41:55,375 --> 00:41:56,291
Gemini Flash,

1412
00:41:56,291 --> 00:41:58,083
which is available in edit mode,

1413
00:41:58,083 --> 00:42:00,750
and I'm going to say Apply green.

1414
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:03,750
This color palette.

1415
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:07,750
And then I'm going to give it this.

1416
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:08,583
This is going to be ugly

1417
00:42:08,583 --> 00:42:09,125
as I'll get out

1418
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:11,166
because I haven't like explicitly

1419
00:42:11,166 --> 00:42:12,541
picked this palette for this purpose.

1420
00:42:12,541 --> 00:42:14,375
I just grabbed an image I had.

1421
00:42:14,375 --> 00:42:16,291
But I've got this color palette file,

1422
00:42:16,291 --> 00:42:16,666
okay.

1423
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:19,125
Which has like some more stuff in it.

1424
00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:19,958
Oh, nice.

1425
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:23,583
Okay.

1426
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:24,541
All right okay.

1427
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:25,625
No flash.

1428
00:42:25,625 --> 00:42:27,208
Yes 2.0 flash.

1429
00:42:27,208 --> 00:42:28,000
And it's it's

1430
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,458
it seems like it's cranking along

1431
00:42:29,458 --> 00:42:32,291
like it gave me responses pretty quick.

1432
00:42:32,291 --> 00:42:33,583
And it's doing what

1433
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:36,250
I would expect it to do.

1434
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:37,541
Oh I love this.

1435
00:42:37,541 --> 00:42:38,583
So it's,

1436
00:42:38,583 --> 00:42:40,833
it's it's not even just defaulting

1437
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:42,333
to hex colors.

1438
00:42:42,333 --> 00:42:45,250
It's actually using these named colors,

1439
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:47,541
as the style.

1440
00:42:47,541 --> 00:42:49,750
So I wonder, is that part of tailwind

1441
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:52,291
or is that is creating a separate CSS

1442
00:42:52,291 --> 00:42:53,791
that has these named colors in it?

1443
00:42:53,791 --> 00:42:56,833
I do believe I do believe it's a tailwind

1444
00:42:57,458 --> 00:42:58,583
telling thing. Okay.

1445
00:42:58,583 --> 00:42:58,916
Yeah.

1446
00:42:58,916 --> 00:42:59,375
You know,

1447
00:42:59,375 --> 00:43:00,291
I'm, I'm

1448
00:43:00,291 --> 00:43:01,583
I'm so old I just

1449
00:43:01,583 --> 00:43:03,666
I still default to bootstrap.

1450
00:43:03,666 --> 00:43:04,000
No.

1451
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,166
Let's to

1452
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:07,458
the thing is we use the tech that we know

1453
00:43:07,458 --> 00:43:08,166
and that we're used to.

1454
00:43:08,166 --> 00:43:09,958
You know what I'm saying, right?

1455
00:43:09,958 --> 00:43:10,750
Yeah.

1456
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:13,625
It's like I was doing the same.

1457
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:15,041
I did a stream earlier today

1458
00:43:15,041 --> 00:43:16,041
and somebody was telling

1459
00:43:16,041 --> 00:43:18,541
me to stop using. Whoa.

1460
00:43:20,416 --> 00:43:20,958
It's ugly,

1461
00:43:20,958 --> 00:43:23,958
but it's right.

1462
00:43:24,083 --> 00:43:24,666
To stop

1463
00:43:24,666 --> 00:43:28,541
using npm and instead use p and p m.

1464
00:43:28,541 --> 00:43:30,250
And I was like, you know, you know,

1465
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,541
I but

1466
00:43:31,541 --> 00:43:34,750
I'm just doing what I'm used to, right?

1467
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:34,958
Yeah.

1468
00:43:34,958 --> 00:43:36,250
We, we get these other

1469
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:38,625
like that's, that's a great call out to.

1470
00:43:38,625 --> 00:43:38,958
Okay.

1471
00:43:38,958 --> 00:43:39,958
So you're giving me all kinds

1472
00:43:39,958 --> 00:43:41,291
of great ideas right.

1473
00:43:41,291 --> 00:43:42,666
Like okay.

1474
00:43:42,666 --> 00:43:45,041
Now I'm because I've used Pip forever.

1475
00:43:45,041 --> 00:43:47,333
Right. But I know there's other options.

1476
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:51,083
So let's ask I so I use two, right.

1477
00:43:51,166 --> 00:43:53,166
Yeah. I just I mean it's forever right.

1478
00:43:53,166 --> 00:43:53,375
All right

1479
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:54,666
I'm going to go for a fast

1480
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:57,125
one like oh for mini.

1481
00:43:57,125 --> 00:43:57,875
So for mini.

1482
00:43:57,875 --> 00:44:00,125
No. There it is. Yes. Okay.

1483
00:44:00,125 --> 00:44:04,000
And I'm going to ask it, well, should

1484
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:04,708
I use

1485
00:44:06,375 --> 00:44:08,375
instead of Pip

1486
00:44:08,375 --> 00:44:09,125
because I know

1487
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:10,708
there's other module managers out there.

1488
00:44:10,708 --> 00:44:13,208
I just haven't gotten used to them.

1489
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:13,791
Guess what?

1490
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:15,250
We've been making all these changes.

1491
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:16,833
We should we should do a comment.

1492
00:44:16,833 --> 00:44:19,833
You know? Oh, my gosh.

1493
00:44:20,458 --> 00:44:21,458
No way.

1494
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:21,833
Okay,

1495
00:44:21,833 --> 00:44:22,458
since

1496
00:44:22,458 --> 00:44:23,541
we're both working at the same code

1497
00:44:23,541 --> 00:44:25,166
base, let's make two different branches.

1498
00:44:25,166 --> 00:44:27,375
What do you think? Oh, yeah. Okay.

1499
00:44:27,375 --> 00:44:28,250
All right,

1500
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:31,250
so I'm just going to make a new branch

1501
00:44:31,833 --> 00:44:33,375
and I'm going to call this one

1502
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:35,583
package on.

1503
00:44:35,583 --> 00:44:36,333
And what did I use?

1504
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:40,958
I used, Gemini to recur.

1505
00:44:41,291 --> 00:44:44,500
And this is like clod 3.5

1506
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,208
plus plus.

1507
00:44:49,208 --> 00:44:50,291
And this is a great

1508
00:44:50,291 --> 00:44:53,750
to show off of this button to exactly

1509
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:56,791
buy auto generate.

1510
00:44:57,041 --> 00:45:00,041
Here we go.

1511
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,875
The one thing about this auto generating

1512
00:45:03,875 --> 00:45:05,666
comment commit situation though,

1513
00:45:05,666 --> 00:45:07,791
there's so long sometimes.

1514
00:45:07,791 --> 00:45:09,458
And for me I'm like,

1515
00:45:09,458 --> 00:45:10,625
I would never write so much

1516
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:11,791
in a commit message.

1517
00:45:11,791 --> 00:45:13,208
But these very long

1518
00:45:13,208 --> 00:45:14,583
commit messages have saved me

1519
00:45:14,583 --> 00:45:16,208
so many times

1520
00:45:16,208 --> 00:45:17,833
when trying to figure out issues.

1521
00:45:18,791 --> 00:45:19,583
Mine for

1522
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:22,666
some reason, is not actually generating.

1523
00:45:22,666 --> 00:45:24,458
I've never had this happen before.

1524
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:27,041
Are things staged?

1525
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:29,250
We call that a plus.

1526
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:30,791
I could yeah, just add.

1527
00:45:30,791 --> 00:45:32,333
Oh, man. This. Well. Oh.

1528
00:45:32,333 --> 00:45:34,833
Well, this,

1529
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:38,166
Yeah, this is, Yeah, I get it.

1530
00:45:38,166 --> 00:45:38,500
No.

1531
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,500
Yeah, yeah.

1532
00:45:42,083 --> 00:45:43,250
Okay.

1533
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:46,250
Mac specific.

1534
00:45:46,958 --> 00:45:49,125
Oh, right.

1535
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:52,125
Yeah.

1536
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,416
Bad coding,

1537
00:45:55,416 --> 00:45:56,416
code and everything.

1538
00:45:56,416 --> 00:45:59,416
Even your even your get configs.

1539
00:46:05,666 --> 00:46:07,375
Weird is I thought I had not.

1540
00:46:07,375 --> 00:46:07,708
There we go.

1541
00:46:07,708 --> 00:46:10,708
Okay.

1542
00:46:11,375 --> 00:46:12,750
It is in there.

1543
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:13,291
Why is it.

1544
00:46:13,291 --> 00:46:15,458
Oh

1545
00:46:15,458 --> 00:46:18,208
I'm just saying that it.

1546
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:18,458
All right.

1547
00:46:18,458 --> 00:46:19,083
I'm not gonna

1548
00:46:19,083 --> 00:46:19,708
I'm not going to bother

1549
00:46:19,708 --> 00:46:21,000
debugging this right now. I'm just.

1550
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,375
Yeah, it's not worth it.

1551
00:46:22,375 --> 00:46:25,375
Honestly.

1552
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:27,666
But I mean, that said,

1553
00:46:27,666 --> 00:46:29,125
the answer gave is correct.

1554
00:46:29,125 --> 00:46:31,208
Of course. But.

1555
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:32,041
All right, there we go.

1556
00:46:32,041 --> 00:46:33,541
I've got I've got a commit message here.

1557
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:34,625
This is pretty nice, actually.

1558
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,458
It says like it is too long.

1559
00:46:36,458 --> 00:46:37,833
Yes, but,

1560
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:39,041
it's telling me

1561
00:46:39,041 --> 00:46:40,041
that it's implementing it.

1562
00:46:40,041 --> 00:46:41,750
It says it out of the back backend API.

1563
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:42,666
It create the front end.

1564
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:44,583
Oh, wow. Is like,

1565
00:46:44,583 --> 00:46:46,291
this is a really nice detailed

1566
00:46:46,291 --> 00:46:47,208
commit message.

1567
00:46:47,208 --> 00:46:49,166
It's very long, very detailed.

1568
00:46:49,166 --> 00:46:50,916
It is very long though. Yes.

1569
00:46:52,625 --> 00:46:53,166
Okay.

1570
00:46:53,166 --> 00:46:56,166
And I'm just going to think that.

1571
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:58,666
I'm going to

1572
00:46:58,666 --> 00:47:00,875
or I didn't get a great answer.

1573
00:47:00,875 --> 00:47:01,375
And I think it's

1574
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,291
because I wasn't detailed enough.

1575
00:47:02,291 --> 00:47:04,041
I said, what should I use instead of pep?

1576
00:47:04,041 --> 00:47:06,375
And then it just says, well, you can use

1577
00:47:06,375 --> 00:47:07,500
and this is true.

1578
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,750
Like if you don't have

1579
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:11,125
Pip itself installed, but you do have

1580
00:47:11,125 --> 00:47:12,666
Python module Pep,

1581
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:14,000
you can call Python three

1582
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,750
and just say execute this module Pep.

1583
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,541
But that's not really what I meant.

1584
00:47:17,541 --> 00:47:20,541
Can I use

1585
00:47:21,541 --> 00:47:23,500
a different

1586
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,750
Python

1587
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:28,708
module manager

1588
00:47:28,708 --> 00:47:31,708
other than Pep?

1589
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:34,083
What are the pros

1590
00:47:34,083 --> 00:47:37,083
and cons of each?

1591
00:47:39,666 --> 00:47:41,291
Okay,

1592
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:42,291
and I love how we are going

1593
00:47:42,291 --> 00:47:43,625
between agent edit

1594
00:47:43,625 --> 00:47:47,708
and ask to kind of show how you can use

1595
00:47:47,708 --> 00:47:49,875
these three different modes. Right.

1596
00:47:49,875 --> 00:47:52,875
So ask is really good at figuring out

1597
00:47:52,875 --> 00:47:53,625
what can I use

1598
00:47:53,625 --> 00:47:55,916
rather than pep figuring out, oh,

1599
00:47:55,916 --> 00:47:57,541
how can I improve this

1600
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,083
particular function?

1601
00:47:59,083 --> 00:48:00,875
Oh, do you have any ideas on that?

1602
00:48:00,875 --> 00:48:01,500
You know what I mean.

1603
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,000
Just like kind of talking

1604
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,833
through changes that you want to do.

1605
00:48:04,833 --> 00:48:05,916
Edit mode is for those

1606
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:08,041
specific changes that you want.

1607
00:48:08,041 --> 00:48:09,833
So you add the specific context.

1608
00:48:09,833 --> 00:48:10,875
You ask you what you want

1609
00:48:10,875 --> 00:48:12,416
and then it goes ahead and do it.

1610
00:48:12,416 --> 00:48:13,625
And then agent mode

1611
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:15,291
is when you just want to vibe, you know,

1612
00:48:15,291 --> 00:48:17,583
you just want you just want things done.

1613
00:48:17,583 --> 00:48:18,750
So you just use Agent Mode

1614
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:20,291
to get it done for you.

1615
00:48:20,291 --> 00:48:21,875
And we tend to use like flow.

1616
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:23,083
I mean, we've seen this today, right?

1617
00:48:23,083 --> 00:48:24,166
We tend to just kind of flow

1618
00:48:24,166 --> 00:48:25,833
between them.

1619
00:48:25,833 --> 00:48:26,375
You can kind of

1620
00:48:26,375 --> 00:48:28,583
think I do it any given time, right?

1621
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:28,833
Yeah.

1622
00:48:29,791 --> 00:48:31,083
Yeah okay.

1623
00:48:31,083 --> 00:48:31,541
This is great.

1624
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:33,125
Now it's giving me

1625
00:48:33,125 --> 00:48:35,000
some good complete

1626
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,083
now, now that I've prompted it

1627
00:48:37,083 --> 00:48:37,583
the right way

1628
00:48:37,583 --> 00:48:38,166
and really told it

1629
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:42,791
what I was trying to do and, and poetry,

1630
00:48:42,791 --> 00:48:45,333
I have heard of poetry and I have not,

1631
00:48:45,333 --> 00:48:46,750
made use of that yet.

1632
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:49,708
Sadly, I'm told it has some times faster.

1633
00:48:49,708 --> 00:48:51,500
Yeah. Which they call out here too.

1634
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,958
And does this Pi project more files?

1635
00:48:53,958 --> 00:48:56,208
So,

1636
00:48:56,208 --> 00:48:58,291
specific and well-defined

1637
00:48:58,291 --> 00:48:58,833
for what you're going

1638
00:48:58,833 --> 00:49:01,083
to want to have for packages.

1639
00:49:01,083 --> 00:49:03,750
Wow. So many options.

1640
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:04,791
It's too many of these things

1641
00:49:04,791 --> 00:49:06,541
essentially just stick with Pip,

1642
00:49:06,541 --> 00:49:07,333
you know.

1643
00:49:07,333 --> 00:49:08,375
No, I don't

1644
00:49:08,375 --> 00:49:11,375
I probably will I say I'll change, but I

1645
00:49:12,125 --> 00:49:13,208
so you

1646
00:49:13,208 --> 00:49:14,583
you updated your UI,

1647
00:49:14,583 --> 00:49:16,000
which gave me the idea

1648
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,291
to take a screenshot and ask

1649
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:24,250
ask copilot how can I, update

1650
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:27,541
this UI like any suggestions?

1651
00:49:28,041 --> 00:49:28,625
Yeah.

1652
00:49:29,875 --> 00:49:31,916
And you're using a screenshot.

1653
00:49:31,916 --> 00:49:33,291
So,

1654
00:49:33,291 --> 00:49:34,416
that means that you don't

1655
00:49:34,416 --> 00:49:35,041
even have to have it

1656
00:49:35,041 --> 00:49:37,625
inspect the code itself,

1657
00:49:37,625 --> 00:49:39,125
which should make them

1658
00:49:39,125 --> 00:49:39,541
a little bit

1659
00:49:39,541 --> 00:49:40,375
more lightweight

1660
00:49:40,375 --> 00:49:41,916
and easier for it to process.

1661
00:49:41,916 --> 00:49:43,000
Right. Exactly.

1662
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,916
So I'm going to just go to ask mode.

1663
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:48,916
And oh three many doesn't have vision

1664
00:49:50,583 --> 00:49:50,916
okay.

1665
00:49:50,916 --> 00:49:53,250
For oh has vision or.

1666
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:54,958
Oh yeah oh one preview

1667
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:55,750
or one preview does.

1668
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:58,291
So these smaller ones don't have vision.

1669
00:49:58,291 --> 00:50:01,125
So let's use let's use for oh okay.

1670
00:50:01,125 --> 00:50:04,791
They're 4.504.5 is a newer one okay.

1671
00:50:04,791 --> 00:50:07,250
That doesn't have visual on.

1672
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:10,250
Let's just use for oh so many models.

1673
00:50:10,583 --> 00:50:13,208
I mean I can't keep them on my head.

1674
00:50:13,208 --> 00:50:14,583
Yes.

1675
00:50:14,583 --> 00:50:16,416
How can I improve this UI?

1676
00:50:16,416 --> 00:50:19,416
That's all I'm going to say.

1677
00:50:20,833 --> 00:50:21,250
Again,

1678
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:23,208
these type of abstract questions

1679
00:50:23,208 --> 00:50:25,541
we can ask chat I love it.

1680
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:30,000
So accessibility

1681
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,291
enhancements, form validation, feedback.

1682
00:50:34,333 --> 00:50:36,291
That's you

1683
00:50:36,291 --> 00:50:40,541
responsive design load indicators.

1684
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:42,875
How do you know there's a load indicator

1685
00:50:42,875 --> 00:50:43,916
I know right.

1686
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:45,333
Like it's just kind of a it's

1687
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:46,750
it's putting in some great

1688
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:48,375
generic suggestions

1689
00:50:48,375 --> 00:50:49,125
even though it doesn't

1690
00:50:49,125 --> 00:50:50,291
actually have the information

1691
00:50:50,291 --> 00:50:51,583
as to whether this one there or not.

1692
00:50:51,583 --> 00:50:53,916
It can't from the static screenshot,

1693
00:50:53,916 --> 00:50:55,625
improve visual hierarchy.

1694
00:50:55,625 --> 00:50:57,166
Okay.

1695
00:50:57,166 --> 00:51:00,041
User feedback on actions and hands

1696
00:51:00,041 --> 00:51:03,041
room cards,

1697
00:51:03,083 --> 00:51:04,541
security improvements.

1698
00:51:04,541 --> 00:51:06,166
Is it going through the code? What?

1699
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:07,083
What did reference?

1700
00:51:07,083 --> 00:51:07,500
No.

1701
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,208
See, I wonder if some of this is because

1702
00:51:09,208 --> 00:51:10,458
of the copilot instructions.

1703
00:51:10,458 --> 00:51:11,583
Because I actually said

1704
00:51:11,583 --> 00:51:13,041
in the instructions

1705
00:51:13,041 --> 00:51:15,000
do a security pass on everything.

1706
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,541
There we go. He's not.

1707
00:51:16,541 --> 00:51:17,583
So even though it's

1708
00:51:17,583 --> 00:51:18,750
just doing the visual thing

1709
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:20,541
here, it's still reminding us. So that's

1710
00:51:21,625 --> 00:51:22,291
that's interesting.

1711
00:51:22,291 --> 00:51:23,541
We might actually want to go.

1712
00:51:23,541 --> 00:51:24,458
I mean, we could leave it,

1713
00:51:24,458 --> 00:51:26,583
but we this would imply to me

1714
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,000
too, that I should

1715
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,166
improve my standard

1716
00:51:29,166 --> 00:51:30,458
copilot instructions file,

1717
00:51:30,458 --> 00:51:32,291
and I should put a caveat in there.

1718
00:51:32,291 --> 00:51:32,833
You know, that

1719
00:51:32,833 --> 00:51:35,291
like if when you're giving advice

1720
00:51:35,291 --> 00:51:36,625
about the code itself,

1721
00:51:36,625 --> 00:51:38,166
then talk about the security.

1722
00:51:38,166 --> 00:51:39,250
If you're doing

1723
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:40,916
nine step or something, don't.

1724
00:51:40,916 --> 00:51:43,541
So I could improve that.

1725
00:51:43,541 --> 00:51:45,333
But also see I error

1726
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:46,708
that would be a really good addition

1727
00:51:46,708 --> 00:51:48,333
to the instructions.

1728
00:51:48,333 --> 00:51:49,833
So reference the instructions.

1729
00:51:49,833 --> 00:51:50,583
The screenshot.

1730
00:51:50,583 --> 00:51:53,791
And I forgot that I had the index.html

1731
00:51:53,791 --> 00:51:54,333
file open.

1732
00:51:54,333 --> 00:51:55,416
So that's

1733
00:51:55,416 --> 00:51:56,041
that's where it's

1734
00:51:56,041 --> 00:51:58,750
getting the validation feedback.

1735
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:01,291
Accessibility. The loading indicators.

1736
00:52:01,291 --> 00:52:02,500
So that's how it knows

1737
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,416
that it's not there okay.

1738
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:05,958
So it's not just like randomly.

1739
00:52:05,958 --> 00:52:08,166
Yeah I was like wait how do you do that.

1740
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:09,500
Because the file is open

1741
00:52:11,208 --> 00:52:11,791
right?

1742
00:52:11,791 --> 00:52:12,708
Right. Which is a good thing.

1743
00:52:12,708 --> 00:52:13,916
Which is a good thing to think about.

1744
00:52:13,916 --> 00:52:15,375
And you could remove it.

1745
00:52:15,375 --> 00:52:15,791
Yes.

1746
00:52:15,791 --> 00:52:16,541
But,

1747
00:52:16,541 --> 00:52:18,041
you're in fact,

1748
00:52:18,041 --> 00:52:18,833
we should call out this little

1749
00:52:18,833 --> 00:52:19,958
UI thing, right?

1750
00:52:19,958 --> 00:52:21,458
Because as you said,

1751
00:52:21,458 --> 00:52:22,833
you were in edit mode.

1752
00:52:22,833 --> 00:52:23,708
You dragged in.

1753
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:24,458
Oh, you weren't asked mode,

1754
00:52:24,458 --> 00:52:26,166
but you dragged in certain files.

1755
00:52:26,166 --> 00:52:27,541
But it also always pays

1756
00:52:27,541 --> 00:52:28,250
attention to the file

1757
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:29,208
you currently have open

1758
00:52:29,208 --> 00:52:30,875
and focused in your editor pane.

1759
00:52:30,875 --> 00:52:33,041
Unless you hit that little

1760
00:52:33,041 --> 00:52:34,833
this little icon here.

1761
00:52:34,833 --> 00:52:36,958
So you could have

1762
00:52:36,958 --> 00:52:38,625
if we'd know this question.

1763
00:52:38,625 --> 00:52:40,291
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

1764
00:52:40,291 --> 00:52:42,125
But these are honestly

1765
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:44,625
very good suggestions.

1766
00:52:44,625 --> 00:52:45,916
I love it.

1767
00:52:45,916 --> 00:52:47,000
You know,

1768
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,958
so one thing we haven't talked about,

1769
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:49,541
because you got me thinking

1770
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:50,458
about security

1771
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:51,125
is we haven't thought

1772
00:52:51,125 --> 00:52:52,458
talked about the

1773
00:52:52,458 --> 00:52:53,541
all the other adjacent

1774
00:52:53,541 --> 00:52:55,666
like other than just producing code

1775
00:52:55,666 --> 00:52:58,000
and talking about code and config.

1776
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,375
What are the other things

1777
00:52:59,375 --> 00:53:01,083
that we tend to use Copilot for, right.

1778
00:53:01,083 --> 00:53:02,750
So security's one of them.

1779
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:04,000
Security

1780
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,125
I might say something

1781
00:53:05,125 --> 00:53:06,166
in, in ask

1782
00:53:06,166 --> 00:53:07,166
mode like,

1783
00:53:07,166 --> 00:53:08,708
you know, at workspace again

1784
00:53:08,708 --> 00:53:09,333
I just want you to look

1785
00:53:09,333 --> 00:53:10,958
at everything now. Right.

1786
00:53:10,958 --> 00:53:13,916
How can I make this app more secure.

1787
00:53:13,916 --> 00:53:15,500
And I'm going to pop it here to.

1788
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:18,291
You're using for preview.

1789
00:53:18,291 --> 00:53:19,625
I can.

1790
00:53:19,625 --> 00:53:21,791
Well, yeah. Oh, for many even.

1791
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:23,916
Oh for many, yeah.

1792
00:53:23,916 --> 00:53:25,500
Oh through many then.

1793
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,750
Okay. Oh, this'll be fun.

1794
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:28,125
All right.

1795
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,250
I should have waited to

1796
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:34,208
hit enter until you did.

1797
00:53:34,208 --> 00:53:36,583
Then we could have done so. Here.

1798
00:53:36,583 --> 00:53:38,125
But in order to answer that.

1799
00:53:38,125 --> 00:53:40,166
Oh, it's still talking like a pirate.

1800
00:53:40,166 --> 00:53:43,083
I may need to stop and

1801
00:53:43,083 --> 00:53:44,166
what we're seeing right now. Two.

1802
00:53:44,166 --> 00:53:44,916
You're on. Oh, three.

1803
00:53:44,916 --> 00:53:46,000
Many. I'm on oh four.

1804
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,208
Even though I hit enter

1805
00:53:47,208 --> 00:53:50,208
first, you're getting responses.

1806
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,750
That's true.

1807
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:53,041
Okay.

1808
00:53:53,041 --> 00:53:56,041
And I'm just going to remove that pilot.

1809
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:59,333
Oh, I thought it had flavor.

1810
00:53:59,333 --> 00:54:01,291
I just, you know, Ahoy there.

1811
00:54:01,291 --> 00:54:04,291
Maybe so.

1812
00:54:05,458 --> 00:54:07,541
Now much like space information.

1813
00:54:07,541 --> 00:54:08,291
So I wonder

1814
00:54:08,291 --> 00:54:10,250
if I've actually stalled out here.

1815
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:13,250
I'm just going to stop testing request.

1816
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:14,291
Oh.

1817
00:54:14,291 --> 00:54:15,333
Something I was just going to

1818
00:54:15,333 --> 00:54:16,666
say was so to

1819
00:54:16,666 --> 00:54:18,125
and kind of answer that question

1820
00:54:18,125 --> 00:54:18,541
that I,

1821
00:54:18,541 --> 00:54:19,250
that we've been seeing

1822
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:20,791
floating around of like,

1823
00:54:20,791 --> 00:54:22,250
what model do I use?

1824
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:24,375
How do I know what model to use.

1825
00:54:24,375 --> 00:54:25,458
It's it's

1826
00:54:25,458 --> 00:54:28,291
just it's a matter of trying the model.

1827
00:54:28,291 --> 00:54:30,250
If you get the output you like,

1828
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:31,166
you know, you keep it.

1829
00:54:31,166 --> 00:54:32,125
But if you don't,

1830
00:54:32,125 --> 00:54:33,125
you remove the output

1831
00:54:33,125 --> 00:54:34,083
from the context window

1832
00:54:34,083 --> 00:54:34,958
or the generation

1833
00:54:34,958 --> 00:54:36,041
from the context window.

1834
00:54:36,041 --> 00:54:37,625
Try a different model.

1835
00:54:37,625 --> 00:54:38,375
You know what I mean?

1836
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:39,916
If you want to go back and forth,

1837
00:54:39,916 --> 00:54:41,458
think in thinking mode.

1838
00:54:41,458 --> 00:54:43,250
Use a reasoning model.

1839
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:44,375
If you want to,

1840
00:54:44,375 --> 00:54:45,250
you know, not use up

1841
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:46,750
your tokens too much.

1842
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:49,291
You know code 3.5 is a really good one.

1843
00:54:49,291 --> 00:54:50,958
I think, even GPT

1844
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:52,291
four is a good one too.

1845
00:54:52,291 --> 00:54:53,583
Or like Copilot base

1846
00:54:53,583 --> 00:54:56,583
or for four one is a good option.

1847
00:54:56,958 --> 00:54:58,083
So let's look at our

1848
00:54:58,083 --> 00:54:59,958
security recommendations.

1849
00:55:01,041 --> 00:55:02,375
I mean, I'm liking them.

1850
00:55:02,375 --> 00:55:04,208
They're they're solid, right?

1851
00:55:04,208 --> 00:55:04,750
Like, okay, let's

1852
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:06,291
keep going in debug mode.

1853
00:55:06,291 --> 00:55:09,291
Of course, I don't have any Https.

1854
00:55:09,333 --> 00:55:10,625
I don't have any SRF.

1855
00:55:10,625 --> 00:55:11,541
I mean, of course,

1856
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:12,166
like all the things

1857
00:55:12,166 --> 00:55:13,375
you'd expect for like,

1858
00:55:13,375 --> 00:55:16,375
hey, I'm just blasting out this project

1859
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:19,750
vibe coding by coding, then,

1860
00:55:20,333 --> 00:55:20,666
I just,

1861
00:55:20,666 --> 00:55:21,791
I think that's one of those things.

1862
00:55:21,791 --> 00:55:23,791
It's like so important too.

1863
00:55:23,791 --> 00:55:25,208
Is that

1864
00:55:25,208 --> 00:55:26,125
there's a big difference

1865
00:55:26,125 --> 00:55:27,916
between making an app that works

1866
00:55:27,916 --> 00:55:28,708
and making an app

1867
00:55:28,708 --> 00:55:30,125
that's production ready

1868
00:55:30,125 --> 00:55:32,041
and can really go out there, right?

1869
00:55:32,041 --> 00:55:35,375
Yeah, probably the most important thing.

1870
00:55:35,375 --> 00:55:36,333
So nothing else.

1871
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,875
Like all y'all vibe

1872
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:38,500
coders out there,

1873
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,333
you're building awesome stuff.

1874
00:55:40,333 --> 00:55:41,375
Once you figured out

1875
00:55:41,375 --> 00:55:42,666
how to not just make it work

1876
00:55:42,666 --> 00:55:45,500
on localhost, your next step,

1877
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,833
make sure you ask copilot,

1878
00:55:47,833 --> 00:55:49,416
how can I make this more secure?

1879
00:55:49,416 --> 00:55:50,833
What's wrong with it?

1880
00:55:50,833 --> 00:55:52,208
And go through and just follow

1881
00:55:52,208 --> 00:55:53,083
all those recommendations?

1882
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:53,875
Because yes,

1883
00:55:53,875 --> 00:55:55,541
I want to put something out there

1884
00:55:55,541 --> 00:55:56,541
and then the next day

1885
00:55:56,541 --> 00:55:58,625
have someone worm their way in and just,

1886
00:55:58,625 --> 00:56:01,166
I know it was all your keys,

1887
00:56:01,166 --> 00:56:02,625
and that's what's been happening.

1888
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:04,541
That's that's what's been happening

1889
00:56:04,541 --> 00:56:06,125
and it's been painful.

1890
00:56:06,125 --> 00:56:07,125
But yeah,

1891
00:56:07,125 --> 00:56:09,250
these are actually very solid suggestions

1892
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:11,833
from both. Both models. Yeah. Yeah

1893
00:56:12,791 --> 00:56:13,291
I love it.

1894
00:56:13,291 --> 00:56:13,875
I'll have to I

1895
00:56:13,875 --> 00:56:16,208
have to go figure out what flask WTF.

1896
00:56:16,208 --> 00:56:17,000
That's I've never heard of that

1897
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
I know I've never

1898
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,750
I've never heard of that.

1899
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:21,250
All right. Cool.

1900
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:22,541
So what's another thing

1901
00:56:22,541 --> 00:56:24,166
that, that we always want to do.

1902
00:56:24,166 --> 00:56:27,166
Besides just security passes,

1903
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:30,250
security passes,

1904
00:56:31,125 --> 00:56:33,625
accessibility pass

1905
00:56:33,625 --> 00:56:35,708
accessibility I love it.

1906
00:56:35,708 --> 00:56:36,000
All right,

1907
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:36,875
let's let's grab

1908
00:56:36,875 --> 00:56:39,875
another I'm going to go this time with

1909
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:43,333
what haven't we played with here?

1910
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:46,333
I don't think I've done 4.5, actually.

1911
00:56:46,416 --> 00:56:50,416
I, either okay together or space.

1912
00:56:50,541 --> 00:56:52,083
So like space.

1913
00:56:52,083 --> 00:56:55,958
How can I share this?

1914
00:56:56,166 --> 00:56:59,166
Is.

1915
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:03,041
Is,

1916
00:57:03,125 --> 00:57:04,916
it's accessible.

1917
00:57:04,916 --> 00:57:07,375
Okay.

1918
00:57:07,375 --> 00:57:09,000
Now we're both using the same model here,

1919
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,958
but we use,

1920
00:57:11,958 --> 00:57:12,833
We're getting some

1921
00:57:12,833 --> 00:57:15,833
some slightly different, Awesome.

1922
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,708
So like, see, the content is the same

1923
00:57:18,708 --> 00:57:19,625
but the format is very

1924
00:57:19,625 --> 00:57:21,041
the format is different. Yeah.

1925
00:57:24,416 --> 00:57:25,000
I love that they

1926
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,458
both give us, like,

1927
00:57:26,458 --> 00:57:27,583
okay, here's what you have

1928
00:57:27,583 --> 00:57:28,875
and here's how you can improve it.

1929
00:57:28,875 --> 00:57:30,666
Type thing.

1930
00:57:30,666 --> 00:57:31,000
Yeah.

1931
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,875
Just this example changes kind of stuff.

1932
00:57:33,875 --> 00:57:35,583
Yes. Oh and then yours.

1933
00:57:35,583 --> 00:57:36,458
This is great.

1934
00:57:36,458 --> 00:57:38,750
Yours is going on to even like

1935
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:41,291
more detailed color contrast keyboard.

1936
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,958
Now with navigation you

1937
00:57:43,958 --> 00:57:46,958
yes page title and headings.

1938
00:57:47,083 --> 00:57:48,875
These are really really good

1939
00:57:48,875 --> 00:57:51,375
solid suggestions.

1940
00:57:51,375 --> 00:57:51,916
Yeah.

1941
00:57:51,916 --> 00:57:53,208
For anyone who doesn't who hasn't

1942
00:57:53,208 --> 00:57:53,833
come across the term

1943
00:57:53,833 --> 00:57:55,458
accessibility before.

1944
00:57:55,458 --> 00:57:57,041
What we mean here

1945
00:57:57,041 --> 00:57:59,000
is things like making this available

1946
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,083
to people who are colorblind and, or

1947
00:58:02,083 --> 00:58:03,041
have low vision

1948
00:58:03,041 --> 00:58:05,291
capabilities or even blind.

1949
00:58:05,291 --> 00:58:08,250
And there's other subtle things too.

1950
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:09,458
But this is all about making sure

1951
00:58:09,458 --> 00:58:12,458
that your site is usable by someone,

1952
00:58:12,875 --> 00:58:14,458
regardless of their personal differences

1953
00:58:14,458 --> 00:58:15,083
and experiences.

1954
00:58:15,083 --> 00:58:18,083
It's too easy to assume that, hey,

1955
00:58:18,125 --> 00:58:18,750
you know,

1956
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:20,416
I experienced the site a certain way,

1957
00:58:20,416 --> 00:58:21,791
so everybody else does,

1958
00:58:21,791 --> 00:58:23,333
but there's really simple things

1959
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,250
that can trip people up.

1960
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:25,416
Like if two colors,

1961
00:58:25,416 --> 00:58:26,833
it's hard to see the difference.

1962
00:58:26,833 --> 00:58:27,375
If you have certain

1963
00:58:27,375 --> 00:58:29,166
kinds of colorblindness,

1964
00:58:29,166 --> 00:58:30,333
then you're not going to know

1965
00:58:30,333 --> 00:58:31,625
that those are two different buttons,

1966
00:58:31,625 --> 00:58:32,291
or they need to do

1967
00:58:32,291 --> 00:58:34,500
two different things, right.

1968
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,041
So this is a really good pass.

1969
00:58:36,041 --> 00:58:37,125
Just make sure it's it's

1970
00:58:37,125 --> 00:58:38,416
available for everyone.

1971
00:58:38,416 --> 00:58:40,375
And also worth noting,

1972
00:58:40,375 --> 00:58:42,541
if you're working for certain

1973
00:58:42,541 --> 00:58:43,833
government agencies

1974
00:58:43,833 --> 00:58:45,958
or certain government funded agencies,

1975
00:58:45,958 --> 00:58:47,833
you're actually required in certain

1976
00:58:47,833 --> 00:58:48,583
cases

1977
00:58:48,583 --> 00:58:50,041
to make sure

1978
00:58:50,041 --> 00:58:51,708
that your interfaces are accessible.

1979
00:58:51,708 --> 00:58:52,916
So it's not just a good idea

1980
00:58:52,916 --> 00:58:54,041
to legal requirement.

1981
00:58:54,041 --> 00:58:56,458
We just did an accessibility pass.

1982
00:58:56,458 --> 00:58:59,458
What about, testing?

1983
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,333
Testing?

1984
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:04,166
What good is an app without testing?

1985
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:05,041
I'm going to call out something

1986
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:05,666
specific here

1987
00:59:05,666 --> 00:59:07,916
to do in my copilot instructions, because

1988
00:59:07,916 --> 00:59:08,875
I did okay about this.

1989
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,791
A testing requirements, right?

1990
00:59:12,791 --> 00:59:15,541
Include unit tests for new functionality,

1991
00:59:15,541 --> 00:59:17,666
minimum code coverage percentage.

1992
00:59:17,666 --> 00:59:18,291
Like. Right.

1993
00:59:18,291 --> 00:59:18,958
How much of my code

1994
00:59:18,958 --> 00:59:20,875
is actually touched by tests,

1995
00:59:20,875 --> 00:59:22,708
integration tests for API endpoints.

1996
00:59:22,708 --> 00:59:23,916
Obviously we can expand this,

1997
00:59:23,916 --> 00:59:26,916
but okay, I'm going to go with oh form.

1998
00:59:27,916 --> 00:59:30,375
Oh no.

1999
00:59:30,375 --> 00:59:31,750
Oh three mini.

2000
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:33,583
Oh. You want to do a 3 or 4 again okay.

2001
00:59:33,583 --> 00:59:33,875
All right.

2002
00:59:33,875 --> 00:59:35,458
That's cool, that's cool.

2003
00:59:35,458 --> 00:59:38,458
And we're in asked mode.

2004
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:39,416
Yeah I'm just going to

2005
00:59:39,416 --> 00:59:40,166
workspace it again.

2006
00:59:40,166 --> 00:59:42,708
I think it's a lot of work workspace.

2007
00:59:42,708 --> 00:59:42,833
It's

2008
00:59:42,833 --> 00:59:44,958
not it's not such a big application yet.

2009
00:59:44,958 --> 00:59:46,791
If we had let's.

2010
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:47,458
I was going to say

2011
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:48,875
like I'd hesitate to use

2012
00:59:48,875 --> 00:59:51,875
at workspace in a larger project,

2013
00:59:51,958 --> 00:59:53,416
because it would just be too much.

2014
00:59:53,416 --> 00:59:54,916
But here it's only going to include,

2015
00:59:54,916 --> 00:59:57,791
like 20 files maybe, or so. Yeah.

2016
00:59:57,791 --> 00:59:59,875
So we also have a slash command

2017
00:59:59,875 --> 01:00:00,958
slash test

2018
01:00:00,958 --> 01:00:03,541
which is slash tests at workspace

2019
01:00:03,541 --> 01:00:04,958
slash tests as well.

2020
01:00:06,125 --> 01:00:06,708
We can just do

2021
01:00:06,708 --> 01:00:09,708
that directly.

2022
01:00:10,875 --> 01:00:12,041
The one thing here

2023
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:15,041
I'll say is,

2024
01:00:15,583 --> 01:00:17,583
The, the the idea of generating tests,

2025
01:00:17,583 --> 01:00:19,875
it sounds like we can add to this. Right.

2026
01:00:19,875 --> 01:00:22,250
So aside from just saying slash tests,

2027
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:25,833
I might say something like he make

2028
01:00:25,833 --> 01:00:29,250
tests and use.

2029
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:29,583
And here

2030
01:00:29,583 --> 01:00:32,208
I'm going to call it a specific file.

2031
01:00:32,208 --> 01:00:33,708
And I'm going to

2032
01:00:33,708 --> 01:00:36,708
that data file data dot Json

2033
01:00:37,083 --> 01:00:40,083
or data validation.

2034
01:00:41,291 --> 01:00:42,875
So that it won't just be like okay.

2035
01:00:42,875 --> 01:00:43,208
Yeah.

2036
01:00:43,208 --> 01:00:43,750
You got a

2037
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:45,791
you got a 200 okay on a page,

2038
01:00:45,791 --> 01:00:47,000
but it'll actually look at what

2039
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,458
it should be returning

2040
01:00:48,458 --> 01:00:51,041
from our data source. Nice.

2041
01:00:51,041 --> 01:00:52,666
That's that's a great tip.

2042
01:00:52,666 --> 01:00:54,250
Right.

2043
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:55,583
So it.

2044
01:00:55,583 --> 01:00:57,125
Oh. Ooh.

2045
01:00:57,125 --> 01:00:58,125
So the first thing

2046
01:00:58,125 --> 01:01:01,125
oh three minute okay okay.

2047
01:01:02,375 --> 01:01:04,416
Oh I need a Python interpreter.

2048
01:01:04,416 --> 01:01:06,041
When did my interpreter.

2049
01:01:06,041 --> 01:01:07,333
Why do I keep getting it.

2050
01:01:07,333 --> 01:01:09,166
No I mean yeah

2051
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:10,791
it should automatically pick your

2052
01:01:10,791 --> 01:01:11,541
you think but.

2053
01:01:12,666 --> 01:01:13,875
Oh well

2054
01:01:13,875 --> 01:01:17,083
Oh I tell I test versus test.

2055
01:01:17,083 --> 01:01:18,125
I'm going to go with pi test.

2056
01:01:18,125 --> 01:01:19,083
I think

2057
01:01:19,083 --> 01:01:21,750
I'll have to redo this one second.

2058
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:22,500
Is it. Yeah.

2059
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:23,750
It's stalled out on that.

2060
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:26,625
Sure.

2061
01:01:26,625 --> 01:01:27,708
No.

2062
01:01:27,708 --> 01:01:30,708
Make tests.

2063
01:01:34,083 --> 01:01:36,000
Can type because I'm rushing.

2064
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,791
Yeah, I have this.

2065
01:01:38,791 --> 01:01:39,583
Most of the time.

2066
01:01:39,583 --> 01:01:41,000
This thing I see like, the faster

2067
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,125
you go, the slower you go.

2068
01:01:42,125 --> 01:01:45,125
And it's it's consistently so true.

2069
01:01:45,541 --> 01:01:46,416
I wonder if we should use

2070
01:01:46,416 --> 01:01:49,416
station mode for this.

2071
01:01:49,416 --> 01:01:52,416
Oh, because we are in chat.

2072
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:53,500
Yeah,

2073
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:54,541
but it's actually doing more

2074
01:01:54,541 --> 01:01:57,541
than I would expect in in ask mode.

2075
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,333
Right.

2076
01:02:03,333 --> 01:02:03,875
Oh, okay.

2077
01:02:03,875 --> 01:02:06,583
Go.

2078
01:02:06,583 --> 01:02:07,291
Select.

2079
01:02:07,291 --> 01:02:08,791
Yes. Okay.

2080
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:09,333
That's sweet.

2081
01:02:09,333 --> 01:02:10,416
So this is one of these

2082
01:02:10,416 --> 01:02:11,083
cool things right.

2083
01:02:11,083 --> 01:02:15,250
I, we get used to certain ideas and

2084
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,916
copilot will work in VS code.

2085
01:02:18,916 --> 01:02:20,875
It'll work in the JetBrains

2086
01:02:20,875 --> 01:02:22,541
series of IDE is

2087
01:02:22,541 --> 01:02:25,208
we've got a chat in eclipse now,

2088
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:26,708
which is really cool.

2089
01:02:26,708 --> 01:02:29,041
And then we've got code completion

2090
01:02:29,041 --> 01:02:30,000
but not full chat

2091
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,000
and a few other ideas like,

2092
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:34,500
Tim.

2093
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,208
But I will say, like,

2094
01:02:37,208 --> 01:02:39,833
even though I used to use idea

2095
01:02:39,833 --> 01:02:40,791
JetBrains stuff

2096
01:02:40,791 --> 01:02:43,208
a lot, like that's kind of most

2097
01:02:43,208 --> 01:02:44,583
nowadays

2098
01:02:44,583 --> 01:02:46,083
the integration between

2099
01:02:46,083 --> 01:02:47,583
Copilot and VS code,

2100
01:02:47,583 --> 01:02:48,333
where it can do

2101
01:02:48,333 --> 01:02:50,250
things like it can automatically fire

2102
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:52,416
off these separate panels,

2103
01:02:52,416 --> 01:02:53,583
tell vs code

2104
01:02:53,583 --> 01:02:55,125
how to attach the test frameworks,

2105
01:02:55,125 --> 01:02:57,333
that kind of stuff. To me that's huge.

2106
01:02:57,333 --> 01:02:58,750
That's part of what really keeps

2107
01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:01,083
me using it in this environment.

2108
01:03:01,083 --> 01:03:03,041
Yeah,

2109
01:03:03,041 --> 01:03:04,666
huge.

2110
01:03:04,666 --> 01:03:07,666
So oh for many responded

2111
01:03:07,958 --> 01:03:08,708
and you know

2112
01:03:08,708 --> 01:03:10,750
you have all these steps and stuff.

2113
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:11,791
Oh three mini

2114
01:03:11,791 --> 01:03:13,083
just told me here's

2115
01:03:13,083 --> 01:03:13,791
a step by step

2116
01:03:13,791 --> 01:03:16,250
overview of what tests will be created.

2117
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:17,708
And then that's it.

2118
01:03:19,416 --> 01:03:20,291
Stopped it.

2119
01:03:20,291 --> 01:03:22,458
So did change the import Json.

2120
01:03:22,458 --> 01:03:25,041
But then it didn't go beyond that.

2121
01:03:25,041 --> 01:03:27,541
Okay, I wonder if if you keep that.

2122
01:03:27,541 --> 01:03:28,875
Oh actually I didn't

2123
01:03:28,875 --> 01:03:31,000
I didn't notice this right here.

2124
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,791
I keep forgetting I keep oh no no.

2125
01:03:33,791 --> 01:03:35,708
You you sorry. Yes.

2126
01:03:35,708 --> 01:03:36,750
Yeah I keep forgetting

2127
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:38,041
this new UI where like,

2128
01:03:38,041 --> 01:03:40,625
you can see the files that were changed

2129
01:03:40,625 --> 01:03:42,375
right in the context window.

2130
01:03:42,375 --> 01:03:44,541
So that's a good color

2131
01:03:44,541 --> 01:03:46,291
because I was ready to say, like it

2132
01:03:46,291 --> 01:03:48,833
didn't do it. Right. Right.

2133
01:03:48,833 --> 01:03:50,875
But it did. Actually.

2134
01:03:50,875 --> 01:03:53,291
Oh, yours. Do your tests pass?

2135
01:03:53,291 --> 01:03:55,250
I mean it did it did do it.

2136
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:58,250
It went through it made it my tests.

2137
01:03:58,541 --> 01:03:59,833
Now that said,

2138
01:03:59,833 --> 01:04:01,500
this is the entirety of the test,

2139
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:03,791
so I'm not super happy with that.

2140
01:04:03,791 --> 01:04:04,791
And you know how you said,

2141
01:04:04,791 --> 01:04:06,083
hey, we should commit?

2142
01:04:06,083 --> 01:04:07,583
You're absolutely right.

2143
01:04:07,583 --> 01:04:07,750
Yeah.

2144
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:11,250
Because I cannot undo all this.

2145
01:04:12,166 --> 01:04:13,125
And we're going to always

2146
01:04:13,125 --> 01:04:14,500
commit as you go.

2147
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:17,166
would say it's not like making it test.

2148
01:04:17,166 --> 01:04:17,791
So now that I know why

2149
01:04:17,791 --> 01:04:21,583
I should using pi test, why not?

2150
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:24,541
Okay.

2151
01:04:24,541 --> 01:04:26,125
surprisingly, all the tests

2152
01:04:26,125 --> 01:04:29,125
passed.

2153
01:04:29,291 --> 01:04:30,416
So let's take a quick look through.

2154
01:04:30,416 --> 01:04:30,625
Okay.

2155
01:04:30,625 --> 01:04:31,125
It's it's

2156
01:04:31,125 --> 01:04:32,208
it's got it's embedded

2157
01:04:32,208 --> 01:04:34,375
the data in Python,

2158
01:04:34,375 --> 01:04:35,875
which is maybe not the way I would do it,

2159
01:04:35,875 --> 01:04:37,583
but I get I get it.

2160
01:04:37,583 --> 01:04:38,958
Okay.

2161
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:40,708
What do we actually have for tests here.

2162
01:04:40,708 --> 01:04:41,083
Yeah.

2163
01:04:41,083 --> 01:04:44,083
So we have.

2164
01:04:44,666 --> 01:04:45,000
Yeah.

2165
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,125
Loading up the data.

2166
01:04:46,125 --> 01:04:49,250
Keep it all right.

2167
01:04:51,041 --> 01:04:54,208
Testing the room, testing for testing.

2168
01:04:54,208 --> 01:04:56,416
Get rooms,

2169
01:04:56,416 --> 01:04:59,416
testing, reservation suitable.

2170
01:04:59,833 --> 01:05:01,333
I would restructure it, but it's.

2171
01:05:01,333 --> 01:05:03,750
But it's a good set of tests.

2172
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:04,750
Success checking.

2173
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:07,208
Success checking.

2174
01:05:07,208 --> 01:05:08,833
This is really good actually.

2175
01:05:08,833 --> 01:05:10,291
And I am very impressed

2176
01:05:10,291 --> 01:05:11,125
and surprised that it

2177
01:05:11,125 --> 01:05:12,500
ran on the first try. Yeah,

2178
01:05:13,958 --> 01:05:14,375
yeah.

2179
01:05:14,375 --> 01:05:15,458
Well, one

2180
01:05:15,458 --> 01:05:15,833
thing that

2181
01:05:15,833 --> 01:05:16,541
strikes me about

2182
01:05:16,541 --> 01:05:18,833
this is that these are not item

2183
01:05:18,833 --> 01:05:19,583
potent, right?

2184
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:20,708
I mean, it's kind of

2185
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:22,166
after it runs these tests,

2186
01:05:22,166 --> 01:05:22,666
I don't think there's

2187
01:05:22,666 --> 01:05:23,791
any kind of rollback or anything.

2188
01:05:23,791 --> 01:05:25,250
It's just using Json.

2189
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:26,166
So this is going to actually

2190
01:05:26,166 --> 01:05:29,166
alter our data for the app.

2191
01:05:29,875 --> 01:05:31,750
And I wonder if that's just

2192
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:32,208
you couldn't

2193
01:05:32,208 --> 01:05:33,291
figure out how to do it

2194
01:05:33,291 --> 01:05:35,041
since we weren't using a real database

2195
01:05:35,041 --> 01:05:36,833
with the rollback capability,

2196
01:05:36,833 --> 01:05:37,291
or did it

2197
01:05:37,291 --> 01:05:40,291
put a mock in there and I didn't notice.

2198
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:41,208
Yeah, it didn't

2199
01:05:41,208 --> 01:05:44,333
alter our Json file at all.

2200
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:46,041
Oh, when it ran it okay.

2201
01:05:46,041 --> 01:05:47,208
So it must be doing something.

2202
01:05:47,208 --> 01:05:49,958
Oh here we go. It's right here.

2203
01:05:49,958 --> 01:05:52,500
So it loaded

2204
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:55,500
and it's passing in the original data

2205
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,916
load data overrides here.

2206
01:05:57,916 --> 01:06:00,916
So I think the data it's using is here.

2207
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:02,000
Right?

2208
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,666
I think that's why it created this.

2209
01:06:05,708 --> 01:06:06,291
This dummy

2210
01:06:06,291 --> 01:06:07,750
data sort of situation

2211
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:09,625
so that it wouldn't overwrite the data.

2212
01:06:09,625 --> 01:06:11,333
Dot Json. Interesting.

2213
01:06:11,333 --> 01:06:13,541
That's a funky workaround.

2214
01:06:13,541 --> 01:06:15,083
I would not have thought of.

2215
01:06:15,083 --> 01:06:17,541
Creates temporary data. Yeah, yeah.

2216
01:06:17,541 --> 01:06:19,458
Okay. Okay. All right.

2217
01:06:19,458 --> 01:06:22,458
That's an interesting pattern.

2218
01:06:23,125 --> 01:06:25,791
Like it?

2219
01:06:25,791 --> 01:06:26,875
All right,

2220
01:06:26,875 --> 01:06:27,666
there's one more thing

2221
01:06:27,666 --> 01:06:28,666
I'd love to do

2222
01:06:28,666 --> 01:06:30,791
before we run out of time today.

2223
01:06:30,791 --> 01:06:31,583
Okay?

2224
01:06:31,583 --> 01:06:34,541
Is I would love to talk about

2225
01:06:34,541 --> 01:06:37,375
document patient.

2226
01:06:37,375 --> 01:06:39,458
Good old docs.

2227
01:06:39,458 --> 01:06:40,250
Good old docs.

2228
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:42,458
So how do we think that it's good

2229
01:06:42,458 --> 01:06:43,791
for us to go about doing?

2230
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:46,791
I have an idea in my head, but how would

2231
01:06:47,041 --> 01:06:49,208
I think I would approach it by?

2232
01:06:49,208 --> 01:06:52,208
What I typically do is I'm just gonna

2233
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:55,708
call some stuff here.

2234
01:06:56,208 --> 01:06:59,208
So typically I just have the read me open

2235
01:06:59,916 --> 01:07:03,000
and I would do at workspace in chat mode,

2236
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:05,416
I would use ggplot 3.5

2237
01:07:05,416 --> 01:07:08,000
because Claude is a very good writer.

2238
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:08,416
Okay.

2239
01:07:08,416 --> 01:07:09,958
And I would say

2240
01:07:09,958 --> 01:07:13,333
update the read me based on the

2241
01:07:14,208 --> 01:07:17,375
the current project structure

2242
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:19,083
or something like that.

2243
01:07:19,083 --> 01:07:20,583
Okay, cool.

2244
01:07:20,583 --> 01:07:21,500
I'm going to try

2245
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:22,333
a different approach

2246
01:07:22,333 --> 01:07:23,916
simultaneously, and I'm going to do this

2247
01:07:23,916 --> 01:07:26,208
one using Gemini Flash.

2248
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:29,000
I'm going to do it with edit and I'm

2249
01:07:30,166 --> 01:07:31,791
the source code.

2250
01:07:31,791 --> 01:07:34,791
The templates

2251
01:07:34,791 --> 01:07:37,791
actually yes, it's true,

2252
01:07:37,916 --> 01:07:38,583
I would use

2253
01:07:38,583 --> 01:07:40,458
edit or agent to do this

2254
01:07:40,458 --> 01:07:42,833
because then it actually does it.

2255
01:07:42,833 --> 01:07:43,791
I

2256
01:07:43,791 --> 01:07:44,958
maybe I you know,

2257
01:07:44,958 --> 01:07:47,375
this is a slightly workflow.

2258
01:07:47,375 --> 01:07:48,750
I want to try this out.

2259
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:49,458
Okay.

2260
01:07:49,458 --> 01:07:53,250
Make documentation for this app.

2261
01:07:54,375 --> 01:07:57,875
Give me an exact,

2262
01:08:00,208 --> 01:08:03,208
summary.

2263
01:08:03,208 --> 01:08:04,958
I docs

2264
01:08:04,958 --> 01:08:07,791
and a slash does visual.

2265
01:08:07,791 --> 01:08:09,625
Well, it does multimodal input.

2266
01:08:09,625 --> 01:08:12,625
But if I ask for a workflow diagram.

2267
01:08:14,833 --> 01:08:17,416
Maybe it'll use mermaid or something.

2268
01:08:17,416 --> 01:08:19,916
Next let's be and workflow diagrams

2269
01:08:19,916 --> 01:08:22,916
using mermaid JS.

2270
01:08:22,916 --> 01:08:24,791
Yeah okay.

2271
01:08:24,791 --> 01:08:26,166
So I didn't say include a diagram.

2272
01:08:26,166 --> 01:08:26,833
And I'm going to use

2273
01:08:26,833 --> 01:08:28,750
agent mode and claw 3.5.

2274
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:29,583
That's what I would use

2275
01:08:29,583 --> 01:08:33,833
because sometimes when I ask in ask mode

2276
01:08:34,083 --> 01:08:35,541
if I say update the read me,

2277
01:08:35,541 --> 01:08:36,416
it doesn't,

2278
01:08:36,416 --> 01:08:40,166
return the contents of the read me

2279
01:08:40,166 --> 01:08:42,083
in that code block format

2280
01:08:42,083 --> 01:08:43,875
for me to just apply it.

2281
01:08:43,875 --> 01:08:47,125
So that happens sometimes in ask mode.

2282
01:08:47,416 --> 01:08:48,791
So actually using edit

2283
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,416
or agent is a better move.

2284
01:08:52,041 --> 01:08:53,875
So this will be really interesting right.

2285
01:08:53,875 --> 01:08:55,750
Because both of these modes

2286
01:08:55,750 --> 01:09:00,125
have relative freedom in like being able

2287
01:09:00,125 --> 01:09:02,416
to modify and create

2288
01:09:02,416 --> 01:09:04,250
a large number of files.

2289
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:05,625
But I wonder

2290
01:09:05,625 --> 01:09:07,416
if edit was the wrong approach,

2291
01:09:07,416 --> 01:09:09,583
because I see that it's actually

2292
01:09:09,583 --> 01:09:11,583
rewriting my files

2293
01:09:11,583 --> 01:09:13,791
instead of creating new ones.

2294
01:09:13,791 --> 01:09:14,916
Oh, but you said explicitly

2295
01:09:14,916 --> 01:09:15,625
update the read me.

2296
01:09:15,625 --> 01:09:16,666
Okay, so we might see

2297
01:09:16,666 --> 01:09:19,666
we might see very similar.

2298
01:09:20,458 --> 01:09:22,583
Yeah, yeah,

2299
01:09:22,583 --> 01:09:24,500
I think I think what I'm going to do,

2300
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:25,625
I like this

2301
01:09:25,625 --> 01:09:27,000
I like what it gave me for output.

2302
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,250
It's telling me the API,

2303
01:09:29,250 --> 01:09:31,125
telling me the post, etc..

2304
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:35,333
It's got the workflow diagrams.

2305
01:09:35,333 --> 01:09:37,041
It did it in mermaid.

2306
01:09:37,041 --> 01:09:40,041
Great.

2307
01:09:40,333 --> 01:09:41,500
Let me, let me keep this for

2308
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:43,125
now just so I can preview it

2309
01:09:43,125 --> 01:09:43,791
so we can actually

2310
01:09:43,791 --> 01:09:44,583
see what it looks like.

2311
01:09:48,875 --> 01:09:49,375
There we go.

2312
01:09:49,375 --> 01:09:50,708
We have no renderers up.

2313
01:09:50,708 --> 01:09:50,958
All right.

2314
01:09:50,958 --> 01:09:51,708
So it's got it's

2315
01:09:51,708 --> 01:09:53,083
got all the instructions I had in there.

2316
01:09:53,083 --> 01:09:54,583
It has existing

2317
01:09:54,583 --> 01:09:57,291
set of instructions etc., etc..

2318
01:09:57,291 --> 01:10:00,666
And then it's kind of added sections

2319
01:10:00,666 --> 01:10:01,166
at the end,

2320
01:10:01,166 --> 01:10:04,166
the API endpoints example responses.

2321
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:06,166
Love it.

2322
01:10:06,166 --> 01:10:09,375
Post get delete.

2323
01:10:09,666 --> 01:10:10,791
Yeah.

2324
01:10:10,791 --> 01:10:13,708
And the workflow sequence diagrams.

2325
01:10:13,708 --> 01:10:14,750
If I were in a,

2326
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:15,458
if I weren't just

2327
01:10:15,458 --> 01:10:19,333
using the native embedded,

2328
01:10:19,333 --> 01:10:20,458
markdown renderer

2329
01:10:20,458 --> 01:10:21,666
inside VS code,

2330
01:10:21,666 --> 01:10:23,083
there's other plugins you could use,

2331
01:10:23,083 --> 01:10:23,875
or I could

2332
01:10:23,875 --> 01:10:25,333
commit this into the repo

2333
01:10:25,333 --> 01:10:27,416
and really see the mermaid diagram.

2334
01:10:27,416 --> 01:10:30,416
So actually we do that.

2335
01:10:30,666 --> 01:10:31,958
Yeah. On this side.

2336
01:10:31,958 --> 01:10:33,416
So it just updated it

2337
01:10:33,416 --> 01:10:35,791
maybe because I said update.

2338
01:10:35,791 --> 01:10:39,000
So there isn't a lot of changes.

2339
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:42,125
So it updated the stack.

2340
01:10:42,125 --> 01:10:44,708
It gave it like let me actually go to the

2341
01:10:46,125 --> 01:10:47,333
so we can see this better.

2342
01:10:47,333 --> 01:10:50,333
Hold on.

2343
01:10:50,875 --> 01:10:51,333
Here we go.

2344
01:10:51,333 --> 01:10:53,375
So it updated the

2345
01:10:53,375 --> 01:10:55,708
like the about what the app is about.

2346
01:10:55,708 --> 01:10:56,958
And actually it removed

2347
01:10:56,958 --> 01:10:59,041
tailwind CSS to bootstrap.

2348
01:10:59,041 --> 01:11:02,041
Interestingly

2349
01:11:05,791 --> 01:11:06,375
it updated

2350
01:11:06,375 --> 01:11:08,125
the features

2351
01:11:08,125 --> 01:11:10,000
did actually make that change.

2352
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,041
Was it just it did.

2353
01:11:11,041 --> 01:11:14,041
It's it it bootstrap bootstrap five

2354
01:11:14,375 --> 01:11:17,083
instead of tailwind

2355
01:11:17,083 --> 01:11:19,125
it added testing.

2356
01:11:19,125 --> 01:11:22,125
It updated the project structure.

2357
01:11:22,458 --> 01:11:25,541
And then it added a testing instruction

2358
01:11:25,541 --> 01:11:26,166
and then it added

2359
01:11:26,166 --> 01:11:28,500
like the updated the Json output.

2360
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:31,500
And that's it.

2361
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:31,958
Okay.

2362
01:11:31,958 --> 01:11:34,500
So actually I think your prompts

2363
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:36,333
worked a lot better

2364
01:11:36,333 --> 01:11:39,333
for updating documentation or

2365
01:11:40,041 --> 01:11:42,791
oh or Gemini over Claud.

2366
01:11:42,791 --> 01:11:44,041
Oh okay.

2367
01:11:44,041 --> 01:11:46,375
So I'm going to

2368
01:11:46,375 --> 01:11:49,375
just undo and and do it again

2369
01:11:49,916 --> 01:11:50,916
with a different model,

2370
01:11:50,916 --> 01:11:53,041
with a different model.

2371
01:11:53,041 --> 01:11:53,666
Why not?

2372
01:11:53,666 --> 01:11:54,541
Why are you doing that?

2373
01:11:54,541 --> 01:11:55,291
I'm going to try

2374
01:11:55,291 --> 01:11:56,791
a slightly different approach

2375
01:11:56,791 --> 01:11:58,916
here to where I'm going to.

2376
01:11:58,916 --> 01:12:00,458
I really want it to make a separate

2377
01:12:00,458 --> 01:12:02,000
file for this. This time

2378
01:12:03,125 --> 01:12:05,791
I don't think, oh,

2379
01:12:05,791 --> 01:12:06,791
yeah.

2380
01:12:06,791 --> 01:12:09,083
What if you tell it to

2381
01:12:09,083 --> 01:12:11,208
explicitly create a new file

2382
01:12:11,208 --> 01:12:12,250
in edit mode?

2383
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:15,083
Yeah. Okay.

2384
01:12:15,083 --> 01:12:16,125
Okay. Also I'll do that.

2385
01:12:16,125 --> 01:12:19,125
I also have new file doc someday.

2386
01:12:19,208 --> 01:12:20,458
Yeah.

2387
01:12:20,458 --> 01:12:22,041
I've got all the same in context

2388
01:12:22,041 --> 01:12:25,041
I had before.

2389
01:12:25,916 --> 01:12:27,291
I'm just going to copy,

2390
01:12:27,291 --> 01:12:30,291
copy your prompt and see if I can get.

2391
01:12:33,875 --> 01:12:35,333
Maybe not all of it.

2392
01:12:35,333 --> 01:12:36,666
Oh, okay.

2393
01:12:36,666 --> 01:12:39,666
Okay. Yes, it did. It

2394
01:12:39,958 --> 01:12:42,958
nice.

2395
01:12:43,125 --> 01:12:46,291
And so here we have Gemini

2396
01:12:46,291 --> 01:12:48,125
updating the read me

2397
01:12:48,125 --> 01:12:50,166
in the context window

2398
01:12:50,166 --> 01:12:53,916
instead of in the Readme file.

2399
01:12:54,541 --> 01:12:57,541
This is something I noticed with Gemini

2400
01:12:57,833 --> 01:12:58,666
a lot of times

2401
01:12:58,666 --> 01:13:01,666
where it won't actually do the thing,

2402
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,333
it will say okay,

2403
01:13:03,333 --> 01:13:04,625
it will do it in the window

2404
01:13:04,625 --> 01:13:06,125
and like I have to apply it.

2405
01:13:07,625 --> 01:13:08,541
That interesting.

2406
01:13:08,541 --> 01:13:09,000
So like

2407
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,041
here is the entire updated read me,

2408
01:13:11,041 --> 01:13:13,083
which actually looks beautiful.

2409
01:13:13,083 --> 01:13:14,583
So Gemini is a Gemini

2410
01:13:14,583 --> 01:13:17,583
2.5 Pro is a go for read me.

2411
01:13:17,875 --> 01:13:22,083
But it didn't actually apply it.

2412
01:13:22,416 --> 01:13:24,625
And because like I said with read Me's

2413
01:13:24,625 --> 01:13:26,125
it doesn't return all of it

2414
01:13:26,125 --> 01:13:27,125
in that,

2415
01:13:27,125 --> 01:13:28,166
like a code block

2416
01:13:28,166 --> 01:13:30,416
with in markdown format.

2417
01:13:30,416 --> 01:13:32,166
So all of this would have to be like

2418
01:13:32,166 --> 01:13:35,166
copy pasted, copy paste it.

2419
01:13:36,125 --> 01:13:37,458
But okay, so now I'm going to say

2420
01:13:37,458 --> 01:13:40,458
okay I wonder if there's a way to use it.

2421
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,000
File. Now.

2422
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:42,750
Yeah I'm going to say

2423
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:44,458
okay update the file now.

2424
01:13:46,625 --> 01:13:49,250
And see if that will work.

2425
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:50,541
Sweet.

2426
01:13:50,541 --> 01:13:52,000
Meanwhile I actually actually went

2427
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,125
and pushed my last,

2428
01:13:53,125 --> 01:13:54,208
not the last set of changes,

2429
01:13:54,208 --> 01:13:54,958
but the one before

2430
01:13:54,958 --> 01:13:57,291
where it put the output into the read me.

2431
01:13:57,291 --> 01:13:58,666
I pushed it up to GitHub

2432
01:13:58,666 --> 01:13:59,500
just so that

2433
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:02,958
people can see what this must look like.

2434
01:14:03,416 --> 01:14:04,208
Yeah.

2435
01:14:04,208 --> 01:14:06,250
Oh, that's so nice.

2436
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:09,833
Oh wow. That's nice,

2437
01:14:11,541 --> 01:14:12,541
that's nice.

2438
01:14:12,541 --> 01:14:12,791
Yeah.

2439
01:14:12,791 --> 01:14:14,541
So now I can see the actual interaction

2440
01:14:14,541 --> 01:14:17,541
between all my components on every flow.

2441
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,000
See, my PM is going to love this.

2442
01:14:24,458 --> 01:14:25,166
Do we have anything else

2443
01:14:25,166 --> 01:14:26,583
we want to try or.

2444
01:14:26,583 --> 01:14:28,500
I think I wrap up, I know I'm right.

2445
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:30,041
We did security.

2446
01:14:30,041 --> 01:14:32,416
Security accessible ability.

2447
01:14:32,416 --> 01:14:33,875
We did testing.

2448
01:14:33,875 --> 01:14:35,708
We did documentation.

2449
01:14:35,708 --> 01:14:36,958
I think that's good.

2450
01:14:36,958 --> 01:14:39,958
And we played with so many models

2451
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:43,083
for this project.

2452
01:14:43,083 --> 01:14:45,958
I think the key, a key takeaway

2453
01:14:45,958 --> 01:14:48,291
I have is quote 3.5.

2454
01:14:48,291 --> 01:14:50,875
Sonnet is still very good for everyday

2455
01:14:50,875 --> 01:14:53,000
coding tasks. Yeah.

2456
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,833
And even like oh three and zero

2457
01:14:54,833 --> 01:14:56,708
for many as well.

2458
01:14:56,708 --> 01:14:58,250
Those, those also did really well

2459
01:14:58,250 --> 01:14:59,833
in they're fast.

2460
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:00,250
Yeah.

2461
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:01,041
Especially for just like

2462
01:15:01,041 --> 01:15:02,208
pure like fairly

2463
01:15:02,208 --> 01:15:04,208
contained code generation.

2464
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:06,041
Those performed beautifully.

2465
01:15:06,041 --> 01:15:07,500
And then Claude three five

2466
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:08,750
was really good in agent

2467
01:15:08,750 --> 01:15:10,041
mode for that large building.

2468
01:15:11,083 --> 01:15:13,041
both Claude three five and

2469
01:15:13,041 --> 01:15:15,125
Gemini two five Pro

2470
01:15:15,125 --> 01:15:16,916
did a great job with that.

2471
01:15:16,916 --> 01:15:17,458
A gentle

2472
01:15:17,458 --> 01:15:18,125
quirk of

2473
01:15:18,125 --> 01:15:20,500
just like completely build something.

2474
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:22,125
Greenfield for us.

2475
01:15:22,125 --> 01:15:23,416
Agreed.

2476
01:15:23,416 --> 01:15:27,250
And I, I really love the way that Gemini

2477
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:29,000
two a flash did documentation.

2478
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,375
I think that was really super solid.

2479
01:15:30,375 --> 01:15:33,083
Yes, I actually agree.

2480
01:15:33,083 --> 01:15:36,041
And that's why I ended up switching

2481
01:15:36,041 --> 01:15:37,541
to Gemini two Pro,

2482
01:15:37,541 --> 01:15:39,791
because it's it's really good

2483
01:15:39,791 --> 01:15:41,541
at technical documentation

2484
01:15:41,541 --> 01:15:42,541
because I'm just scrolling

2485
01:15:42,541 --> 01:15:43,541
through what it did right now

2486
01:15:43,541 --> 01:15:44,291
and I'm just like,

2487
01:15:44,291 --> 01:15:47,041
yeah, this looks really good, I love it.

2488
01:15:47,041 --> 01:15:49,541
So key takeaway in terms of

2489
01:15:49,541 --> 01:15:52,541
what's the best model to use.

2490
01:15:52,666 --> 01:15:55,666
It depends.

2491
01:15:56,375 --> 01:15:56,708
You know

2492
01:15:56,708 --> 01:15:59,708
those the smaller, faster models.

2493
01:15:59,791 --> 01:16:02,791
You know some of the, the GPT minis

2494
01:16:03,375 --> 01:16:04,291
certainly.

2495
01:16:04,291 --> 01:16:07,041
You know, the flash models,

2496
01:16:07,041 --> 01:16:09,208
good for quick generation,

2497
01:16:09,208 --> 01:16:12,583
the reasoning models, really good

2498
01:16:12,583 --> 01:16:14,125
for talking through

2499
01:16:14,125 --> 01:16:15,875
and also for building documentation

2500
01:16:15,875 --> 01:16:17,000
because they're just verbose

2501
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,208
and they have all the right stuff.

2502
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,541
We saw benefits

2503
01:16:20,541 --> 01:16:23,541
of using the visual inputs.

2504
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:24,916
Oh, yeah.

2505
01:16:24,916 --> 01:16:25,750
Gemini.

2506
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:28,375
And on GPT four. Oh,

2507
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:30,791
for fixing up the UI the way we want.

2508
01:16:30,791 --> 01:16:32,083
And I'm sure there's lots of other things

2509
01:16:32,083 --> 01:16:34,500
we could do with them.

2510
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:37,333
So all in all, try the models.

2511
01:16:37,333 --> 01:16:39,000
You have access to them,

2512
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,750
not just in, copilot in VS code,

2513
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:43,416
but also on GitHub models.

2514
01:16:43,416 --> 01:16:43,708
You know,

2515
01:16:43,708 --> 01:16:44,333
you can

2516
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:46,250
test out so many models on

2517
01:16:46,250 --> 01:16:48,458
github.com using GitHub models.

2518
01:16:48,458 --> 01:16:49,875
So go forth and play.

2519
01:16:49,875 --> 01:16:51,666
Have fun, have fun.

2520
01:16:51,666 --> 01:16:53,375
Don't be so serious.

2521
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:55,583
Have fun.

2522
01:16:55,583 --> 01:16:57,583
That's what it's all about.

2523
01:16:57,583 --> 01:16:57,833
Yeah.

2524
01:16:57,833 --> 01:16:59,541
It's been awesome working with you today.

2525
01:16:59,541 --> 01:17:00,791
Thank you so much.

2526
01:17:00,791 --> 01:17:01,958
This has been really,

2527
01:17:01,958 --> 01:17:04,833
really good, really, really fun. Wicked.

2528
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:06,875
All right, I'll see you. Yeah. Hi.
